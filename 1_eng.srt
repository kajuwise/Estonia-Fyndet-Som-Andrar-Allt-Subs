1
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,840
This is Estonia!

2
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,640
Estonia, what's going on? Can you answer?

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,680
Mayday! Mayday!

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,280
Are you coming to the rescue?

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,680
It looks really bad here now.
Really bad.

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,720
Estonia is not
any accident.

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,840
It is an extremely pervasive
and serious accident

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,080
-with very many victims,
and many, many concerned.

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,600
The ferry accident is
the greatest human tragedy

10
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,560
-which has affected the Nordic region
after the Second World War.

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,000
852 people lost their lives.

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,160
760 remain in the depths of the sea.

13
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,480
Estonia capsized and sank
in just a few minutes.

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,560
How could this happen?

15
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,040
The idea that we should
forget the Estonia accident

16
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,960
-without being sure of what
what happened is completely absurd.

17
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,080
My son is somewhere in the Baltic Sea.

18
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,240
But no one tells why
he is lying there.

19
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,720
And I still do not understand today
why the ship sank.

20
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,520
What really happened to Estonia?

21
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,200
The cause of the accident seems to be

22
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,440
-that the bow visor does not
was properly closed.

23
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,640
There was
several explosive charges on board.

24
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,840
The Accident Investigation Board
have wanted to obscure ...

25
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,960
... that the official statement
not true.

26
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,520
This is not anymore
just an accident and a tragedy.

27
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,280
There's something more behind this.

28
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,840
The investigation appears
as a great betrayal.

29
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,240
A rule of law goes to the bottom
with investigating what is the cause.

30
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,400
Are there then views on
that this should be supplemented by

31
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,000
-and go down and look,
then you respect that.

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,280
I think more young journalists
should go out again

33
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,800
-and take the opportunity to dive
as long as the wreck remains there.

34
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,320
Oh!

35
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,040
It seems like the Coast Guard
waiting for us.

36
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,240
Nothing should stop young journalists
to investigate the case themselves.

37
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,520
-What is your purpose?
-We are documentary filmmakers.

38
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,440
We're making a documentary
about the Estonia accident.

39
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,920
The Finnish Maritime Administration announces
that they believe that the

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,120
-over Estonia has been broken,
despite urges not to do so.

41
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,720
You can not let a ferry
with 850 people just lying

42
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,040
-when the truth does not come out.

43
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,280
I must not rest in my soul
until I get a definitive answer.

44
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,440
Sooner or later
the truth always comes out.

45
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,840
Wait. What the hell!

46
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,520
Oh, fucking! Oh, fucking!

47
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,200
It was very beautiful weather
in Tallinn during the day.

48
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,320
Autumn might have arrived
a little further than in Stockholm.

49
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,920
By September, I had just turned 20.

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,640
Then I went to Estonia to
greetings to my father, who worked there.

51
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,800
I decided to go home
just the day before, I think-

52
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,440
-because I was going home and working
on one of all my extra jobs.

53
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,520
My colleague had received
two free tickets and asked me

54
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,080
-if I wanted to hang on
and see what it looked like over there

55
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:01,080
-after they had become free
from the Soviet Union and so on.

56
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,440
1994 so I guess I am
a Christian, adventurous girl.

57
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,640
I'm going to Bible school.

58
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,960
Going to Estonia was something
which the Bible school had as a tradition.

59
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,280
It was exciting, because it was
my first real trip abroad.

60
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,920
I had just become a father. My
daughter Wilma was not many months old.

61
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,920
This was actually the first time
as I was some time away from home.

62
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,960
I was in Estonia because of
that I was going on a conference trip.

63
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,160
I was very much on the boat
while the boat was in port.

64
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,880
I remember
when I arrived at the port.

65
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,920
I was so fascinated
how big the ship was.

66
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,680
It's quite large.
It is 150 meters long, just over.

67
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,720
For the Estonians, that is it
something big and new to come.

68
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,320
We all ester were very proud
that we had such a modern

69
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,200
-and beautiful ferry, and so on.

70
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,440
Maybe it was also a symbol of
how in just a few years-

71
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,040
-had come forward in time
and could show such a ferry

72
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,600
-for those who went to Estonia
for the first time perhaps in his life.

73
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,920
My dad drove me to the boat
in the afternoon.

74
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,200
When we stood in the parking lot
so we called mom.

75
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,680
He had one like that
huge cell phone, you know.

76
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,200
She was worried about
that I would cross the Baltic Sea

77
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,520
-when it blew so much.

78
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,160
Storm warning:Gulf of Finland,
northern Baltic Sea, Åland Sea

79
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,240
-The archipelago sea. Tomorrow, western
or northwesterly storm, 21 m / s.

80
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,920
I drove the truck on the ferry-

81
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,960
-and drove in through the bow,
where the bow visor is open.

82
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,640
When I get out of the car, they say
just for me to apply the handbrake.

83
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,560
Then I do not see
that they do something more with the cars.

84
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,480
There are no cars strapped in,
even though it's windy.

85
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,680
The trip to Estonia
was planned well in advance.

86
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:44,200
Then Hjørund's mother called me
and asked if he could come along.

87
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,280
Hjørund said that he was very happy
wanted to follow

88
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,760
-and I could not think of
any reason to say no.

89
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,760
But in retrospect, I have thought:

90
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,840
"What if I said no?"

91
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,880
We have our cabins at the very bottom.

92
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,560
Really farthest under car tires.

93
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,840
It was cramped little cabins.
Four beds.

94
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,600
No windows - nothing more.

95
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,680
And that's where you travel
when traveling cheap.

96
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,800
I remember walking around and
thought:"How hard it is to find!"

97
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,360
It was not completely obvious
where to go.

98
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,040
The floor plan was confusing,
with many narrow corridors.

99
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,680
I decided to
to spend the night in the dining room

100
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,240
-instead of the claustrophobic
the cab under the car deck.

101
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,000
As fast as the boat
left the port of Tallinn

102
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,400
- so you got out pretty quickly
on the high seas

103
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,920
-and it started rocking quite early.

104
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,800
I walk around on the boat
and meetings with co-workers.

105
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:06,280
Then we decide to go
to the so-called karaoke bar.

106
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,960
Because there were vacant bar stools.
But the ship heeled so much-

107
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,640
-so could not sit
on the bar stools.

108
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,200
It's probably also called Admirals Pub.

109
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,600
Inside the Pub Admiral
so it's karaoke night.

110
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,720
We had heard that the first couple out
in the karaoke machine-

111
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,040
-are invited for a drink.
Then my friends thought:

112
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,960
"Well, then we take it! We take first
the number, and we'll take the free drink. "

113
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,480
Non-alcoholic, of course.

114
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,120
I decide to sing
this gospel song "Oh happy day".

115
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,120
-Oh happy day ...
-Oh happy day!

116
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,160
There were a lot of people in the pub, I know.
We thought it was very fun.

117
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,360
And so we get that drink,
of course. That was the goal.

118
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,440
Then I know
that I said hello then to them-

119
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,480
-and then I went down to my cabin.

120
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,720
That was the last time
I saw those classmates.

121
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,040
At ten o'clock, roughly, decide
we us to go to bed.

122
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:37,840
My colleague has arranged his own cabin.

123
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,560
The reason for that is
that he snores so much-

124
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,160
-so he thinks
that I would be allowed to sleep alone.

125
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,280
We say good night. My colleague
goes to his cabin on the starboard side

126
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,480
-and I go to my cabin
on the port side.

127
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,120
I know the clock
should have been around twelve at night.

128
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,440
I hear someone's digital clock like
says "beep-beep". It's twelve o'clock.

129
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,280
A little after twelve, then it slams.
Two very powerful bangs.

130
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,120
It sounds
as if the ship was going through ice.

131
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,560
That which makes us jerk
and wake up are-

132
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,040
-that it suddenly
comes a slant.

133
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,000
That's where my bunk starts to lean.

134
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,400
It tilts like this at once. It is
slope, and the slope remains.

135
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,440
I'm not that person at all
who usually rush out undressed-

136
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:15,400
-but the ur-instinct makes me
immediately rush out in just boxer shorts.

137
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,240
And when I get around the corner
then I see that there will be water-

138
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,920
-which rushes in along the wall.

139
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,320
I do not know where the water comes from
from, but this is speeding me up.

140
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,760
The battle side is all the time
jerkily worse. It continues.

141
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,560
All the glasses that were on the tables
drove around and was crushed.

142
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,800
Then I tell my co-workers
that we should leave the ship - out.

143
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,440
While I rush up the stairs
so I want to remember that I hear-

144
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,160
-an alarm signal without pauses. "Rrrrr."

145
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,600
Bottles are smashed in the duty-free shop,
which is on the fifth deck.

146
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,760
And all of a sudden, in front of my eyes
on me, unloads a drink vending machine

147
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,480
-and goes down and thumps in the wall.

148
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,280
A guy shouts, "Take it easy!"
I remember saying something:

149
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,960
"Shit in him!
This is not damn calm. "

150
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,760
Silja Europa. Viking. Estonia.

151
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,840
Estonia, Estonia.

152
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,400
Mayday, mayday.

153
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,040
Estonia, Silja Europa.
Ropar ni mayday?

154
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,920
Estonia, what's going on? Can you answer?

155
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,200
Yes, we have problems here.

156
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,560
We have a strong tilt towards starboard,
probably more than 20 or 30 degrees.

157
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:01,280
Can you come to the rescue?
and try to get Mariella with you?

158
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,840
Yes, Mariella is behind us
and have probably heard you.

159
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,280
Can you give us your position?

160
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:14,720
We have blackout and we ...
I do not really know now ...

161
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,840
Okay, we'm getting started
with the necessary measures.

162
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,720
It's tough to get to the exit.
I experience it as

163
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,440
-that she leans so much that we
almost will not stuff this.

164
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:40,080
I remember many around me
stood frozen. They did nothing.

165
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,440
I remember one person
standing on a sofa.

166
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:49,080
She just stands and screams straight out.
I look at her screaming

167
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,560
-but I hear nothing.

168
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:00,440
We're on the deck where you go on board,
so we are in a large, open hall.

169
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:06,600
Where the hall ends is the exit
to tires. And that's where everyone wants to be.

170
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,880
We are many people standing there.
Everyone is holding the stair railing.

171
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,960
If you drop the grip, you fall
down into the abyss and die.

172
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:25,440
When we stand there, it's a girl
who loses his grip in front of me.

173
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,920
She's going at a high speed,
hits in the head and goes further down.

174
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,240
Then I just think:
"I do not want to see this."

175
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,320
And then I see how this mount
on the stair railing begins to come loose.

176
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,600
We are maybe thirty people
which holds the railing with all its might.

177
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,000
It was ... Ugh!

178
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,160
But then there was one
which was on the outside of the boat-

179
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,000
-and stretched down
and sort of lifted people up.

180
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:07,200
We hear it screaming
down in the stairwell.

181
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,800
We try to help and pull up.
It comes up a 10-12 people.

182
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,079
Had you not received help out there
then we would not have gotten anywhere.

183
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,359
And then it almost goes out
all lights out on lifeboat decks.

184
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I see a ship
very far away.

185
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,160
I understand that situation
is very serious.

186
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,880
That it is a matter of life or death.

187
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,440
I decided to
that I do not intend to accept

188
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,000
-that I have to die as a 26-year-old.

189
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,480
"I have not lived my life yet."

190
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:51,520
"I have to do everything possible
to survive."

191
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,720
Silja Europa, Estonia.

192
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,320
-Estonia, Silja Europa.
- Are you coming to the rescue?

193
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,280
It looks really bad here now.
Really bad.

194
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,800
It is not a question of, but when
you will end up in the water.

195
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,920
Someone has climbed up
and trying to free the lifeboats.

196
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,320
But it is not possible, because the ship is leaning
so much so that the lifeboats remain.

197
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:29,200
The boat continues to get
even more bias.

198
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,560
So in the end, the boat is basically there
at 90 degrees. You stand on the wall.

199
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:39,640
I can see the chimney on this
long ship lying down in the water.

200
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,600
And it is completely inconceivable to see.

201
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,120
While lying on the side
so I have time to grab the railing-

202
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:06,360
-and climb over and out on ships-
side, which becomes like a flat floor.

203
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,600
Then it feels completely unreal.

204
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,200
This is how you can not go on a boat.
It was completely sick.

205
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,760
And we went over the cab windows ...

206
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:25,480
... and thought we did not want to look
or think about what was in there.

207
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,520
I felt:So scared
I've never been in my whole life.

208
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,560
I feel it in my fingertips
how terribly scared I am.

209
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,840
It is cold and painful. MAN
feel this metal against the body.

210
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,440
I'm only in boxer shorts.

211
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,760
When I sit there and watch
so I see dots ...

212
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,040
Gone on the horizon
so I see ship lights.

213
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,120
I will think about my camera
which I have in my pocket.

214
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,960
I snap off a flash
to signal where I am.

215
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:08,120
In the photo moment, I see
no one else around me on the ship.

216
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,080
But then when I get the pictures back
and looking at them-

217
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,160
-so I see that it's a person
which sits on the bottom.

218
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,600
Mariella, Silja Europa.

219
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,160
Yes, Mariella here.

220
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,080
Yes, hey. Do you see Estonia?

221
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,480
-No, but I see a red rocket now.
-Yes, it's probably a flare or something.

222
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,000
We see it on our starboard side.
Okay, we'm heading there.

223
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,720
I have an echo on the radar of 50 miles
about, almost straight south of me.

224
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,920
Okay...

225
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,920
That's where the rocket is,
so we have fifty miles left.

226
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,560
The thing is done.

227
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,720
These are very big waves
which washes over the boat.

228
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,000
I think that's about it
as the captain begins to honk.

229
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,600
It's like a signal,
that it's time to leave the ship.

230
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,960
I see two girls in front of us.

231
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,320
One asks the other
if she can hold her hand

232
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,640
-when they go down to the water.

233
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,880
My co-worker, she wanted to
that we would jump into the water.

234
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,320
I said, "No, we have to
have something more to float on. "

235
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,520
"It's cold in the water.
You can't do it for very long. "

236
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:46,040
And then came these waves
closer and closer all the time.

237
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,920
Finally she said
that we must jump into the water.

238
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,560
Then I took her by the hand,
and so we jumped.

239
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,720
I remember coming down
very far in the water-

240
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,080
-and felt it pull in my pants.
That I was sucked down.

241
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,120
Despite the life jacket and that I swam
as an I-don't-know-what-

242
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,600
-to take me up.

243
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,160
Gets a blow to the head.
Releasing her.

244
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,600
Coming to the surface ...
And she's gone.

245
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,000
I feel pretty fast
that I'm stuck

246
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,000
-and that I'm on my way down with the boat.

247
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,160
I do everything I can to come
loose, but I will not come loose.

248
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,680
And then I think of my mother
and panic.

249
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:54,520
I think:
"It's not possible. They can not ..."

250
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,400
"Mom and Dad and my sister
can not go to my funeral. "

251
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:08,240
And I think about everything I learned
in school. Was it unnecessary, as well?

252
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,280
And from Estonia so ... Poff!
A lifeboat is coming up.

253
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,200
They are released at a certain pressure.

254
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,200
So I swim against one like that.

255
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,200
Then we drift away from the ship.

256
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,000
I get very nauseous in the raft
and bends out to vomit.

257
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,880
Then I see the ship sink.

258
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,520
I see the bulb sticking out
high out of the sea. The entire fleet.

259
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,920
It's almost like a church tower
protruding from the sea.

260
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,840
I knock the other man
on the shoulder and pointing at the ship.

261
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,680
Then he looks at it and says:

262
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,160
"There are probably many who are dying now."

263
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,160
All of a sudden I feel
that I have some ropes.

264
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,040
It's all carbon black around me.

265
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,240
After a while, I realize-

266
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:43,200
-that I ended up
under an upside-down life raft.

267
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,640
Suddenly
so I can hear and feel

268
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,720
-that some are doing
to get to the bottom of the raft.

269
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,840
And I'm eager
to let me know

270
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,880
-because I'm starting to understand
that if there is a rescue operation

271
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,880
-so maybe they forget
that I'm under there.

272
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,720
And I did not want that
that it would happen.

273
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,440
We are slowing down now here.

274
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,680
Mariella slows down. You said something ...
I did not understand what you said.

275
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,160
... we're really close now here.
It's just full of light.

276
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,640
It just seems
as if it were a lot of lifebuoys

277
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,040
and buoy lights around here,
perhaps life rafts.

278
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,920
They're in the lake!

279
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,880
Okay. We are slowly getting closer.
You do not see a boat, do you?

280
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,640
No, there is no boat here.

281
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:49,000
We discovered quite quickly
that our life raft was upside down.

282
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:54,360
So we could not get a roof up,
and the water washed over the raft.

283
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,760
I understand that the next threat is
that I can freeze to death.

284
00:25:59,840 --> 00:25:04,040
I also understand that you can
be flushed from the raft.

285
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:09,040
And I also see that there are several
which it gets late during the night.

286
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,560
Boats are starting to come in
pretty fast-

287
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,400
-who plays with headlights and so on.

288
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,160
We have stopped here now,
and we're really, really close now.

289
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,080
It feels great to know
that you know that this has happened-

290
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,520
-and that help is on the way.

291
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:41,720
But then I also understand
that it is quite difficult and dangerous.

292
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,520
The risk is that we drive over
a lot of people.

293
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,760
Maybe we should go on the side?

294
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,160
It's hard to see
where to drive in that case.

295
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,920
It's probably just as good to be
in the middle of events and drive away.

296
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,440
We're getting pretty close
Viking Mariella.

297
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:03,840
People in the raft start screaming
and shout:"Help! Do you see us?"

298
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,800
It was life threatening to a small
rubber raft goes straight into the side

299
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,400
-on this huge boat
or into the propellers.

300
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,760
I thought
that it was very unpleasant.

301
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,560
We do as it is now that we inflate
a pair of rafts and let go in

302
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,440
-if there is anyone
who manage to get hold of them.

303
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,840
Yes, that's the only possibility.
I judge that the weather is so harsh.

304
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:35,360
It is far from being saved.
I understand that it takes time.

305
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,720
It's a helicopter
on our way here in Turku.

306
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:49,280
They're picking up your tire,
so prepare the deck for the helicopter.

307
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,160
There will also be two helicopters
from Sweden.

308
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,560
The thing is done.
We are preparing our helicopter deck.

309
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,200
Okay.
We'll finish the helicopter deck.

310
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,320
We acknowledge and make arrangements
the helicopter deck at Symphony.

311
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,000
We must also clarify
the helicopter deck.

312
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,320
-We have the helicopter deck ready too.
-Finemang.

313
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,960
I tremble all night
and freezes terribly

314
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,000
-and my teeth tremble.

315
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,920
Sometime during the night I hear
all of a sudden a death cry.

316
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,560
A long, long, long cry of death
which suddenly falls silent.

317
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,200
And then after that
we hear no more sounds or voices.

318
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,200
It's the only death cry I hear.

319
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,520
-but I remember that forever.

320
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,400
When we sit in the raft at night-

321
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,920
-then there will be a very high wave
so that the roof is pressed down.

322
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,680
It's a man who's panicking.

323
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,000
He shouts that we must have a knife
and cut up the raft.

324
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:20,680
He's getting more and more confused,
this person.

325
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:26,040
In the end, he loses consciousness
quite late at night.

326
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,480
I'm grabbing him
and pulls him to me.

327
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,840
I hold him so that the head
is above the water. I think:

328
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,320
"In any case, he should not drown."

329
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,640
In the end, I feel that he
begins to stiffen, that he does not live.

330
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,840
Then I shoot him away from me.

331
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,920
And then he gets to lie there
in the fleet late.

332
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,000
He can stay there. It does not matter.

333
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,640
There are many who lie and float
in the life raft.

334
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,920
There is a fine line
between life and death.

335
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And here there was so little that differed.

336
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:24,520
When it started to get bright, I am
very tired and very cold.

337
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,320
We sit up to the waist in water,
allihopa.

338
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,400
We've been there
for almost 6.5 hours.

339
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:41,560
And I'm really tired and sinking
further and further down in the water-

340
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,040
-and I almost fall asleep.

341
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:53,080
Then I start to think that it is not
some joke to hold on to, but I ...

342
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,800
... let go here
and slides out into the lake.

343
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,520
But then I realize that I have
a nine-month-old Wilma at home.

344
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,720
I have to take care of her. She
need a dad longer than 9 months.

345
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,560
"No, you can not do this!"

346
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,280
"You should do everything you can
to come home again. "

347
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,680
I begin to hear what I interpret
as a helicopter sound, but I think:

348
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,640
"Uh, damn. Some helicopters
does not go out when it is windy like this. "

349
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,280
But it was helicopters.

350
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,080
The wind under the rotor blades is awful.

351
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:23,560
It's like someone throwing a nail at someone,
with all the water drops hitting.

352
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,040
But still fantastic
to be won over.

353
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:41,560
When I finally hear helicopters like
stops over us, then it feels like:

354
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,640
"I can no longer bear it.
Now we have to get out of here. "

355
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,120
I was very, very, very tired.

356
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,800
I shout at them, when you hear
the helicopters buzz around there

357
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,440
-that they must not forget
that I'm under there.

358
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,960
And then all of a sudden
then there will be a huge

359
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:10,200
and we have a helicopter over us.

360
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,360
Then nothing was heard anymore
between us, when we talk.

361
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,240
It's really incredible that someone
has taken a picture of this.

362
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:37,240
I'm in the middle,
almost naked, in only boxer shorts.

363
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,680
I still do not know
if I will survive.

364
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,520
There I had no strength left.

365
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,320
Of course I'm happy
that this picture was taken

366
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,920
-because you can then see
how terrible this accident was.

367
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,480
That it felt so inhuman that
as a young person you have to give up your life

368
00:33:59,560 --> 00:33:04,320
-and can not say hello then to anyone.
That you can not say goodbye to anyone.

369
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:10,159
That you are completely alone,
out in the dark, must ...

370
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,960
We have prepared here
to receive people now.

371
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,440
The entire conference department
is prepared.

372
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,320
Yes that is good.

373
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:36,040
After a while I feel
how it hits the bottom.

374
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,800
It's the lifeguard
which locates where I am somewhere.

375
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:47,199
After just a little while, he takes
the knife and cuts open the bottom and says:

376
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,719
"It's green. You can come here."
I'm lying and just holding on.

377
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:58,080
Then finally I pull myself to him
and I get a hug

378
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,160
-the first thing that happens.

379
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,520
Then he puts on my harness,
and we go up.

380
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,080
I'm the one who goes up last.

381
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,160
The joy is total.
It's not up to me anymore.

382
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,880
There are people here
who takes care of me.

383
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,680
I was overjoyed. I was so happy
over having been rescued.

384
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:48,120
It is strong emotions that come.

385
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,520
It's hard to describe.

386
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:01,840
We come directly from the area and have
picked up six survivors

387
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,040
and released by them on Utö.
There the fuel had run out ...

388
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,240
Injured, dead
and shocked people-

389
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,720
-introduced to the University Hospital
in Turku.

390
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,160
Here are the helicopters
replaced each other all day.

391
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,200
There are many helicopters in the area.
Six or seven are out there.

392
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,680
And a lot of ships in the area.
But the people who are out there

393
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:48,480
-are very difficult to cool down,
so it's tough. It is.

394
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,240
And very high lake.
Between six and ten meter waves.

395
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,120
Not everyone will definitely come
to make it.

396
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,320
The last couple of hours
we have only found dead.

397
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:11,040
But we continue
and trying to find everyone. Thanks.

398
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,480
My colleague...

399
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,960
I asked in the helicopter if they could
provide some information already there-

400
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,400
-but they could not do it.

401
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,240
But only when I got home-

402
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:00,200
-so I understood that he did not
were among the survivors.

403
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:06,880
Because they could then have been identified
and named in newspapers and everything.

404
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,320
And then his name came up
among the dead.

405
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,280
Most of the dead
is still down there.

406
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,160
And so is he.

407
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,080
When we started school again
after this

408
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,920
-then it is
a very empty classroom.

409
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,160
We start by refurnishing.

410
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,280
We can not sit
in a standard classroom furniture-

411
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,640
-when there are thirteen benches empty.

412
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,120
On this conference trip
so we were twelve who left Sweden-

413
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,360
-but we were only three
who came back.

414
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,160
Maybe I did not say often enough
how much I loved him.

415
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:36,320
I said it every now and then, but I did
do not know if I said it enough.

416
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,480
I may not know either
if I was told he was

417
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,360
- such a nice guy as he was.

418
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:26,560
"Losing your child
is losing its future. "

419
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,360
It writes the Swedish author
Naja Marie Aidt.

420
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:38,040
When I went to work
September 28 25 years ago

421
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,840
I looked forward to
to once again be able to socialize

422
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,680
-with my active and always equal
curious son of six and a half years.

423
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,920
But that did not happen.

424
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,840
This day 25 years ago
I remember as an unreal nightmare-

425
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,920
- far from reality.

426
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,760
Only a few weeks later
then it dropped in-

427
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,000
-and then reality went
up for me.

428
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,080
It was not a dream-

429
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:14,080
-but perhaps the most brutal
situation a person can end up in.

430
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,360
Losing a child
- a part of himself.

431
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,000
I would never say more
how much I loved my boy.

432
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:29,360
I never had time to finish
to answer all your questions-

433
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,920
-or with the task
to be your father.

434
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,600
But all the questions you had,
I take them with me.

435
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,160
Why did Estonia sink?

436
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,760
What happened? Who is responsible?

437
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,640
Hjørund never gave up
until he got an answer.

438
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,040
And neither do I.

439
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:56,840
I get no peace in my soul
until I get answers to my questions.

440
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,800
Therefore, it must never be quiet
around this disaster-

441
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:07,520
-until someone can be held accountable
and we relatives get answers.

442
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,240
Estonia capsized and sank
in just a few minutes.

443
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,400
How could this happen?

444
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,640
It is completely unacceptable to over
half a thousand citizens can die

445
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,240
-without even establishing responsibility.

446
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,920
During the 30 years I have
has been a central political

447
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,920
-I have not been with
about such a difficult decision.

448
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,640
Are you thinking of us? How we feel.
What the hell are we going through!

449
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,000
I think they want dark
why the ship sank.

450
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,840
