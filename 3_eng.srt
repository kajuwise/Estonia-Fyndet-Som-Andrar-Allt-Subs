1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,200
Estonia is not
any accident.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,680
It is an extremely pervasive
and serious accident

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,520
-with very many victims
and many, many concerned.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,160
And in a state governed by the rule of law

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,200
-so you have to do everything to apply
the truth about such an accident.

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,760
There must not even be a suspicion
about trying to hide something-

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,040
-or trying to keep something secret.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,360
Decision of 15 December 1994
came as a cold shower.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,400
Then came the rather macabre idea
to cover the ship

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,520
-with a concrete sarcophagus-

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,520
-which has never happened before
in any context.

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,800
It's a strange decision.

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,080
300 million taxpayer money for
disappears from the unemployment insurance fund and child allowance

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,640
-which you throw into the lake,
that no one wants.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,440
To me, that is completely illogical
to cover the ship with concrete

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,480
-if it was a common accident.

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,080
That's disrespectful
to cast people in concrete.

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,080
This had never happened in Norway!

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,760
It seemed to me
as one tried to hide something.

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,040
You do not know about this
really was an accident.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:28,120
What is it that is so secret when one
civilian passenger ship in peacetime

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,840
-travels in peaceful waters
and have an accident?

23
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,720
Why it must be circumvented
with so many secret stamps etc?

24
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,480
A state governed by the rule of law
leaves no effort unscathed

25
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,480
-to find out
what really happened.

26
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,720
Nordica, then we play home.
We have a heavy load in the tire stack.

27
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,720
Slowly comes the book visor
up to the surface.

28
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,040
The bow visor hangs upside down
and is ill-advised.

29
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,280
The force that knocked it off
must have been huge.

30
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,280
The book visor was located
about two kilometers west of the wreck.

31
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,400
This means that the ship has been turned over
after the visor has come off

32
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,960
-for not take in water.

33
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,000
But how quickly after the crash
can not yet be said.

34
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,640
Now that you basically know the reason
will you take even more action?

35
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:18,360
We mean we very quickly
must write a full report

36
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,760
-where we describe a little more fully
what we have technically been able to establish.

37
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:42,400
In December 1994, they knew
that the bow visor had come loose.

38
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,280
Witnesses had seen
that the bow visor was gone.

39
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,320
If the bow visor had come loose, it must
the locking devices have given way.

40
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,280
Let's test the rebar
withstands the pressure.

41
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,240
Our calculations were important to
find out why this happened.

42
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,240
We managed to break it!

43
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,000
What had happened
was obvious from the beginning.

44
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,240
Here we have
Accident Investigation Board Report.

45
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:56,800
It describes what they thought happened
out on the Baltic Sea

46
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,120
the night of September 28, 1994.

47
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,560
On 228 pages
the official answers

48
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,080
-on why the Baltic ferry sank-

49
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,720
-the stormy September night1994.

50
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,320
The answer to the question of why Estonia
bow visor came loose and she capsized

51
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,000
-will be reported.

52
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,040
They worked for several years to come
until these conclusions.

53
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,760
We felt it was a bit close
to search for answers

54
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,560
-on things like you already are
had stated from the beginning.

55
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,040
The locking mechanism
on the bow visor was too weak.

56
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,840
The ramp was forced down due to
mechanical impact of the bow visor.

57
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,000
When the official
Accident Investigation Board, JAIC-

58
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,160
- "Joint Accident
Investigation Commission "-

59
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,080
report came, 1997 in the autumn-

60
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,240
-was my reaction:
"Well, was that how it went?"

61
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,920
"Okay. I'm not an accident investigator."

62
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,200
I could neither say no nor beg.

63
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,800
But there were others
who were better experts than I-

64
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,520
-and who reacted quite quickly
and who contacted us then

65
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,080
members of the Riksdag, and said:
"This is not true."

66
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,960
It contains various maps,
what happened in different places-

67
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,480
-which ships were nearby.

68
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,480
It describes in detail
how the sinking process went

69
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,080
-according to the Accident Investigation Board
perception.

70
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,760
"September 27, 1994, 7:15 p.m.:
Estonia is leaving the port of Tallinn. "

71
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,240
"The boat is about 15 minutes late."

72
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,800
"The weather report that is read out
on the radio just over an hour before departure "-

73
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,680
- "warns of storm
up to 21 meters per second. "

74
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,040
"00.55:first bang."

75
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,240
"The ship is hit by a big wave" -

76
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,280
- "and it is heard
a metallic bang from the bow.

77
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,720
"01.00:
The book visor locking device is missing. "

78
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,160
"Several passengers
and crew members "-

79
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,080
- "hears an abnormal noise
for ten minutes."

80
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,360
"Estonia continues
at the same speed as before. "

81
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:36,040
"01.14:The ship has no list.
The book visor falls off. "

82
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,240
"The ramp inside falls down" -

83
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,040
- "large amounts of water flow in
and upsets the balance. "

84
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,440
"The ship gets a heavy list."

85
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,760
"In about a minute it's gone
0 to 15 degrees to starboard. "

86
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,360
"The commander on the bridge
trying to save the situation "-

87
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,880
- "by steering upwind
and turn port. "

88
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,600
"01.20:The engines stop.
The impact side is 30 degrees. "

89
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,880
"The ship is taking in
20 tonnes of water per second. "

90
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,240
"01.24:Estonia calls mayday."

91
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,000
Mayday, mayday!

92
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,240
"Answered by MS Silja Europa."

93
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,040
This is Silja Europa.
Did you make a mayday call?

94
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,560
"01.25:The strike side is appreciated
to more than 40 degrees starboard. "

95
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,040
"01.29:60 degree tilt."

96
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,600
Silja Europa, Estonia!

97
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,640
"The last radio message
from Estonia is intercepted. "

98
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,720
"Really bad,
it looks really bad here now "-

99
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,159
- "shouts the third mate
Andres Tammes. "

100
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,760
"01.35:The ship capsizes.
The impact side is 80 degrees. "

101
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,200
"01.40:The impact side is 140 degrees."

102
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,960
"01.50:Estonia drops."

103
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,160
"Estonia perishes in the moonlight
and disappears from the radar screens "-

104
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,200
- "about 55 minutes
after the first blow. "

105
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,640
"The final
holding on to the hull "-

106
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,360
- "ends up in the water
or be dragged down into the depths. "

107
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,440
Very detailed report

108
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,600
-but unfortunately it probably is not
what happened.

109
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,320
A ship of that size
does not sink that way so fast.

110
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,560
If there was no other reason
to why water came into the boat.

111
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,560
It was established early on that the bow visor
was to blame for it all.

112
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,840
So that was a conclusion
which was completed

113
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,640
-already when the Accident Investigation Board
started working.

114
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,480
Then they spent three years
to confirm that conclusion.

115
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,560
You did it that way
disregarded all testimonies-

116
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,960
-and all other circumstances
who could speak against that conclusion.

117
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,120
It is, of course, quite the opposite-

118
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,560
-how it should go
in a serious accident investigation.

119
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,960
The Accident Investigation Board did not carry out any
systematic interrogations with survivors.

120
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,400
I've never been a part
of any survey.

121
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,080
You make a declaration of sea.

122
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,920
They can testify
how the ship behaved and sank

123
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,800
-and what they saw and did not see.

124
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,120
I mean the report
and the investigation that has taken place

125
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,000
-not at all illuminating
what has really happened.

126
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,520
The only thing I was questioned about
the accident was after a week in Sweden.

127
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,360
Then the police contacted me and
I gave them a testimony.

128
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,640
I was never allowed to talk to anyone
at the Accident Investigation Board.

129
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,080
The interview was conducted by telephone.

130
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,080
No one called a second, third or
fourth time from the Swedish police.

131
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,240
When I read the minutes today-

132
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,440
-I see almost in every sentence
something that has been misunderstood.

133
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,520
When you immerse yourself in the material
Can you see-

134
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,640
-that one person was considered a witness
for he belonged to the crew.

135
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,400
I, as a passenger,
has not been considered a witness.

136
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,400
Wouldn't they be worth it
to attach faith to?

137
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,920
Do you have that perception
so I think you are wrong.

138
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,360
The battle began
at midnight Swedish time.

139
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,720
While the Accident Investigation Board
says a quarter later.

140
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,880
This is a unique
documents from Estonia.

141
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,520
It's my watch
which I put in my pocket.

142
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Set in Swedish time,
shows when the tilt began-

143
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,080
-because it has just stopped
after twelve o'clock.

144
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,360
That was when it fell to the floor
and the battery fell out.

145
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,520
So the clock stopped then.

146
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,040
I know the clock should have been around
twelve at night because I heard a beep.

147
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,640
A digital clock that beeps somewhere.

148
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,280
A little after twelve
bangs two very powerful bangs.

149
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,080
I thought we might have gone
Because. That was my first thought.

150
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,960
Right on that, my bunk started to tilt.

151
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,240
It tilts like this at once.

152
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,520
And the slope remains.

153
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,160
"01.00:The ship has no list."

154
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,600
The battle side came very quickly.
That went quick.

155
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,400
It's like the bed is getting up.
Then I get dressed.

156
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,520
I'm trying to open the door,
where all my luggage fell down.

157
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,800
Then I feel on the floor
at the door if there is anything more.

158
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,440
Then I find my alarm clock
which I put in my pocket.

159
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,280
I just do that
so that I can open the door

160
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,560
-without getting stuck in anything.
Because it opens inwards.

161
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,520
I decide to get dressed
and go out and see what happens.

162
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,280
When I get a bit up the stairs,
then it begins to carve in the ship-

163
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,720
-and I wonder
what's going on.

164
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,920
"Several passengers
and crew members "-

165
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,920
- "hears an abnormal noise
for 10 minutes. "

166
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,400
"The ship has no list."

167
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:07,400
All loose equipment
went over to the starboard side.

168
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,400
There was stuff on the diagonal.

169
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,480
The battle side is all the time
jerkily worse.

170
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,480
I feel that it is not going well.
It's not heading in the right direction.

171
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,920
"Estonia continues at the same pace.
The ship has no list. "

172
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,680
When I get up the stairs,
tilts the ship to further.

173
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,280
I have to grab the stair railing
to keep me going.

174
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,920
Many lose their grip.

175
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,480
Then you lose your footing and go
slide towards the other end of the boat.

176
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,240
Pretty soon after that
then comes a Coca Cola machine.

177
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,520
It has dropped from the wall.

178
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,320
Now the ship is leaning so much
that you can stand with one foot on the deck

179
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,880
-and one foot on the wall.
You stand as at the bottom of a "V".

180
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,040
01:14:
The ship has no list. "

181
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:07,320
It has gone on appreciatively
5-10 minutes.

182
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,520
This is something that is not true.

183
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,360
We who survived had compiled
a period of time together

184
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,400
-as we agreed.

185
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,280
We met at Ersta and left
through this together.

186
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,600
We arrived at
that we had a very similar view-

187
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,800
-about when things happened.

188
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,120
"I remember,
I was there, I was there ... "

189
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,400
Everything fell into place
and it did not agree

190
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,760
-how it was described
in the accident report.

191
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,400
That's why we started acting,
write a letter.

192
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,560
We were 34
who signed it.

193
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,480
We requested
to get a renewed investigation.

194
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:34,600
An accident commission exists
to find out the cause of an accident.

195
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,240
I'm still convinced
that there are

196
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,360
-in the Accident Investigation Board's report.

197
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:46,880
Everything can be criticized.
Everyone can criticize.

198
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,520
The cause of the accident
was clear to us.

199
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,560
The Accident Investigation Board's theory
why Estonia sank

200
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,440
-was first to hit the visor
away from the shoulder.

201
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,920
Thereafter, the bow ramp falls down

202
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,400
and huge amounts of water
enters the open deck.

203
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,800
The Accident Investigation Board's theory is that
the water caused the boat to sink.

204
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,800
The book visor comes loose

205
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,599
- water enters the car tire
which sinks the ship.

206
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,440
What a ship should do then
according to physical laws is to capsize.

207
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,720
When boats capsize fast,
this is how air pockets arise

208
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,640
-which gives the boat buoyancy.

209
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,160
When ships are upside down

210
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,880
-can they stay very fluid
long thanks to the air in the hull.

211
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,160
The big unanswered question-

212
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,800
-is why she did not tip completely around
and lay and floated very long-

213
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,160
-as had happened
the ferry Jan Heweliusz the year before

214
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,320
-which got tilted,
and immediately turned 180 degrees around

215
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,920
-and lay for 24 hours
and floated that way.

216
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,440
Estonia sank in less than an hour.

217
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,200
How could water come down
under car tires so fast?

218
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,400
It can not be explained by
that the water came only from car tires.

219
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,680
There are those who claim
have seen water under car tires.

220
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,560
Nobody has asked us, they say.

221
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,160
Other than a few,
who have been interrogated.

222
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,560
My cab is under the car deck.

223
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,360
When I get around the corner-

224
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:13,480
-I see that there will be water,
which rushes in along the wall.

225
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,560
There are such quantities
that I understand at once-

226
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,280
-that it is seawater
who have entered the ship.

227
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,400
The water I see
when I get out of my cab

228
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,680
-I wonder where it comes from.

229
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:37,440
I can not understand why it would
be water inside the corridor-

230
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,280
-in a boat under the car deck.

231
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,680
Even today, I can not understand

232
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:52,080
-how the explanation can be
that the bow visor was removed

233
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,440
-if I saw water coming at the bottom-

234
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,600
and not from the stairs where I ran
up, but along the wall.

235
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,480
The water came into the basement-

236
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,680
-from a completely different path
than the one I ran up.

237
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:18,440
No one denies
that the bow visor has come loose.

238
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,960
But that was not the reason
until the ship sank.

239
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,640
September 28, 1994
I worked in Berlin.

240
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,360
I worked as
investigative reporter on Spiegel TV.

241
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,760
I became suspicious
against the Accident Investigation Board

242
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,240
the way they behaved, what they
arrived at and reported on the

243
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,160
-when I interviewed
two key witnesses.

244
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:55,920
Henrik Sillaste and Tanel Moosaar were
two technicians who worked in Estonia.

245
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,040
They were the last two to get out,
via the chimney.

246
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,480
Water also flowed there
when they climbed out.

247
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,880
They came out at the last minute.

248
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,720
We asked to interview them.

249
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:19,160
What we wanted to know
was what they had seen.

250
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,960
From the control room

251
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:29,480
-could they see via a camera
which was aimed at the bow ramp.

252
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:38,680
They looked all the way through the camera
to that the ship tilted 90 degrees.

253
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,400
They drew a picture for us.

254
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,080
Can you draw it?

255
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:50,240
They could see the ramp
from the control room via a camera.

256
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,520
It was never open.

257
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,480
Only small amounts of water
which came in on the pages-

258
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:08,640
-but not large enough quantities
to sink the ship.

259
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:18,240
This goes against
The Accident Investigation Board's theory.

260
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,520
If the ramp was never open

261
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:28,640
-we must determine how water
flowed in so that Estonia sank.

262
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,200
Estonia was built in the German Meyer-
yard, which is still in operation today.

263
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,960
Of course they wanted to defend themselves,
so they called in a group of experts

264
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,120
shipbuilders,
captains and lawyers

265
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,600
-who were specialists in the field.

266
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:01,880
This is car tire on Estonia,
seen from the center and forward.

267
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,640
Here is the bow ramp,
here is the center party.

268
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,360
Port side.

269
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:12,880
They made their own calculations
and collected testimonies.

270
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,880
For example, testimonies from all of them
who lived in the cabins under the car tire.

271
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:25,240
There are indications that
this section was filled with water

272
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,840
-and was under pressure
when the ship leaned to starboard.

273
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,720
The Meyer shipyard came to the conclusion-

274
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,840
-that water must have flowed in
from elsewhere.

275
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,960
Not via car tires, but under it.

276
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:47,280
For them, it really exists
just an explanation for this.

277
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,320
There was a hole in the hull
on starboard side-

278
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,720
-the same side to which the ships are leaning.

279
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:02,360
This hole is probably
the main reason why the ship sank.

280
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,000
That's right
with what really happened.

281
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:16,960
After almost five years of work,
Meyer Shipyard finalizes its final report

282
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,720
and explanation of
why Estonia perished.

283
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,480
The conclusions
are controversial to say the least.

284
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:29,560
The Meyer shipyard claims that it existed
several explosive charges on Estonia

285
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,840
-which detonated during the disaster.

286
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:37,080
Someone placed according to the yard
experts, explosives on board

287
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,880
-which detonated
in connection with the boat sinking.

288
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:45,920
The report states that
that part of the damage

289
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,760
-caused by explosions.

290
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,560
-And it says so in the final report?
-Yes, everything is there.

291
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,360
-Who placed the explosive there?
-I do not know.

292
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,520
Those who did
wanted to sink the ship.

293
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,760
Werner Hummel points out that
the explosions are not the main cause

294
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,560
-but has accelerated the process.

295
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,400
Christer Lindvall, you are
CEO of the Swedish Shipowners' Association.

296
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,920
-And you have been running Silja Line for ten years?
-Yes it is true.

297
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,240
- Do you believe in this information?
-As for the explosion part ...

298
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,000
... I want to say
that it sounds strange.

299
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,600
But I have had the highest confidence in it
Meyer shipyard's previous investigations.

300
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:32,200
And also the chief prosecutor in Stockholm
has taken both the Accident Investigation Board

301
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,800
and the Meyer shipyard report
and equalized

302
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,400
-and said that both
the course of events is probable.

303
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,960
I think it's important to
get the whole ship examined.

304
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,920
It's on the page,
so it can be difficult

305
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,840
-to examine that page
which lies towards the bottom.

306
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,000
But as long as this kind of speculation
will emerge

307
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:56,880
-so I see it as necessary to
that we get a new accident commission.

308
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,480
I'm sure we're here
up to the actual cause-

309
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,840
and the facts.

310
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:11,800
All other causes
or theories are not ...

311
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,320
They do not deserve
to be taken seriously.

312
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,320
We did a standard survey-

313
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,200
-to see if the ship could be salvaged.

314
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,720
Then you have to know
the condition of the vessel. We found out.

315
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:01,040
We examined the entire ship
with an underwater robot.

316
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:06,200
Condition of the vessel,
apart from the

317
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:13,520
-the absent bow visor
and the ramp, was perfect.

318
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:21,720
The only
serious injuries we could see

319
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,280
-was on the bow visor and the ramp.

320
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,360
That you dived those first times-

321
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,800
- we do not know there
what one was looking for at all.

322
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:39,600
It is not known if the entire ship was gone
through and documented on film.

323
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,760
There are pictures that have disappeared,
which one cannot see.

324
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:50,840
Videos, etc. as of different
unknown reasons just do not exist-

325
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,320
-has disappeared.

326
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,520
Why? Why has
the documentation disappeared?

327
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,920
What are the reasons for that?

328
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,440
It is alleged that the wreck was examined

329
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,520
-but we have not seen
any documentation on it.

330
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,360
There are no reports
that the wreck has been examined

331
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,920
-and that it
has given a certain result.

332
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:19,520
We filmed a lot and we
thought that was enough.

333
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,680
But we did not film systematically.

334
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,400
We had no reason to do so.

335
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:33,520
Because we did not expect
to find any damage to the hull.

336
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,560
Our mission was not
to find the cause of the accident.

337
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,160
But it was very clear
what was the cause.

338
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,880
It was the book visor.

339
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,440
The bow visor and the ramp.
That was the reason.

340
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,560
Water in the ship, the ship capsizes.
As simple as that.

341
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,120
With a ro-ro ship
is it that simple.

342
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,440
We must remember that this is
quite difficult things to understand

343
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,880
-and you do not understand
on such things-

344
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,840
- maybe you should not either
poking its nose into.

345
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,400
They get excited
completely without reason-

346
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:27,080
-and they are reminded of their grief
and tears up his wounds.

347
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,680
Does that really make sense?
I do not know what I do.

348
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,640
It is unreasonable that so many do not know
what happened to even loved ones.

349
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,040
I know how it feels.

350
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,280
I lost my parents
when I was 21 years old.

351
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,840
They died in an accident.

352
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,880
At that time I was
very important

353
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,360
-to find out what had happened.

354
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,760
I was glad I could
go to a grave to mourn.

355
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,720
I can only imagine
how it must have felt

356
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,880
-to be left in uncertainty
of the rulers of their own country

357
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,080
-and not get a real explanation.

358
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,720
"The ship sank,
your loved ones are gone. "

359
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,720
"Shut up
and move on with your life. "

360
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:34,680
This is not how the government in a country should be
treat their citizens.

361
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,920
Seminar participants, speakers
- a brief information:

362
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:51,200
We have posted a piece of paper
out in the foyer that we ask you to read.

363
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:56,400
If you sympathize with the content
you are welcome to sign.

364
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,520
In 2000, a conference was organized
on the Estonia disaster

365
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,400
-in Stockholm by the relatives.

366
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,600
I participated in the hope
to perhaps get new information.

367
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,120
There I met
American Gregg Bemis.

368
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,320
I've spent most of it
of my life at sea.

369
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,600
I am also chairman of the board
in two companies.

370
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,560
One is perhaps the largest in the world
commercial diving school.

371
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:30,120
The second is called
Deep Ocean Engineering-

372
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:36,840
-and has probably made more sub-
water robots than any other company.

373
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,400
Gregg had great experience
of diving on wreckage

374
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:46,240
-and wanted to do it too
on the Estonia wreck.

375
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:54,840
Our goal was to find and film
the hole that must be in the hull.

376
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,400
We are looking for the mentioned hole
at the bottom of the ship.

377
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,560
That's the easiest way
to describe it.

378
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,120
Gregg Bemis and his diving team
should look for holes in the hull

379
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,760
-and thus try to prove it
was not just a detached bow visor

380
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,240
-which caused Estonia to sink,
which the Accident Investigation Board has claimed.

381
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,320
I think we can find what we are looking for
in four days.

382
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:23,080
The goal is to find evidence of that
needs a new investigation.

383
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,080
What do you think you will find?

384
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:29,960
I think we will find others
reasons why the ship sank

385
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:34,480
-which does not correspond to what
is stated in the Accident Investigation Board's report.

386
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:40,560
For the first time in several years is
divers on their way down to Estonia's wreck.

387
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,800
We had announced our plans.

388
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,800
When we arrived at the place it was
as if the circus had come to town.

389
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,720
There were press boats everywhere.

390
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,440
The Finnish and
the Swedish coastguard was there.

391
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,520
They tried to persuade us
not to dive.

392
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,920
One Eagle, what are your intentions?

393
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,200
To do my job - just like you.

394
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,000
We have to agree
about how we should behave towards each other.

395
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,640
I have to inform you about

396
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:21,760
-that according to Swedish law it is not
allowed to dive in this place.

397
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:27,280
Seven countries around the Baltic Sea have written
on the Agreement on Peace in Estonia.

398
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,160
Which means diving
at the ship are prohibited.

399
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,320
But the United States has not signed the agreement.

400
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:39,080
They should help us.
They have nothing to lose on it.

401
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,280
Either they get
his own report confirmed

402
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:47,560
-or they realize it exists
need for further investigations.

403
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,680
Do they have nothing to hide-

404
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,200
should they be interested
of finding more evidence.

405
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,400
During the operation

406
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,560
-come both the Swedish
and the Finnish Coast Guard on board.

407
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,520
It was like in a movie.

408
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,239
People came on board and
tried to threaten us while we were filming.

409
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,920
It is a crime in Sweden.

410
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,840
If you were to visit Sweden
on holiday or in another matter-

411
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:24,719
-there is a risk
that the police are involved.

412
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,360
It was completely unreal.
It is international waters.

413
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,159
What we did
was to try to find the truth.

414
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,400
What would a possible new inspection
of the starboard side could lead to?

415
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:57,240
It could possibly be off
value in being able to remove

416
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,160
-some of the rumors about
a large hole on the starboard side.

417
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:09,360
Early in our expedition
we tried to find the big hole.

418
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,880
But it was so clear
large piles of stone and sand

419
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,280
-exactly in that place.

420
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,240
We did not have the opportunity
to remove it.

421
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,600
It would have required resources
which we did not have access to.

422
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,840
But we found a hole.

423
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,840
-Are you kidding me?
-No, this is not a joke!

424
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,120
Gregg! We've found the hole.

425
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,920
It looks small. Someone has tried
cover it with sand.

426
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,720
The sand sinks
all the time down the hole-

427
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,640
-but the top part
is still visible.

428
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,600
All that is needed is a small hole.

429
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,520
We can not say anything about the size,
then we only see a little bit of it.

430
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:26,160
That's all we need. It is enough
to launch a new investigation.

431
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,120
An American-German diving expedition

432
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,640
claims that their
new film footage of Estonia's wreck

433
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,320
-shows one so far
unknown hole in the hull.

434
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,480
But after reviewing the film
in a TV studio in Tallinn today

435
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,440
-beats Finnish representatives
for the Accident Investigation Board back.

436
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:52,000
If there was a hole there
the sand would not have been like that.

437
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,520
Then the sand would have been sucked in
through the hole.

438
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,720
That there would be a hole there
I see as completely impossible.

439
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,720
Swedish experts believe that there is a hole
one claims to have found is a scam.

440
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,880
They apparently found no holes.

441
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,360
They searched very carefully and knew what
they were looking for. They found no holes.

442
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,080
He has failed
with the assignment he undertook.

443
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:19,200
He said:"I can point to a hole.
I am convinced that it exists. "

444
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,000
When he has not done, I think man
will say:"Thank you and hello, Mr. Bemis."

445
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,120
"You have not succeeded
with this mission. "

446
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,960
"Hereby
you are no longer interesting. "

447
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,880
I do not believe in
Conclusion of the Accident Investigation Board.

448
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:47,600
For me, it has all the time
been impossible to believe that ...

449
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:54,320
That a ship
must be covered with concrete

450
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:01,040
-if it is a completely normal accident.
There must be another reason.

451
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,240
I moved to Estonia in 1995.

452
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:12,640
Then I got a visit
by a Finnish lawyer

453
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:19,800
-who worked for the shipyard
who had built the ship Estonia.

454
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:25,080
Of course, they were looking for
opportunities to perhaps find

455
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:30,360
-some reason for the accident
so that they do not become guilty.

456
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:36,000
They had read reports,
I told them my story.

457
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,400
And...

458
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,320
They asked many questions-

459
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:47,600
-but a question,
which I could not forget-

460
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,120
-which seemed to be very important ...

461
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,880
They asked me
about what I saw in the water.

462
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,400
If it could be a submarine.

463
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:08,240
A little after twelve it slams
giant bangs.

464
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,400
It sounds like the fart
goes through ice.

465
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,880
I rush straight up the stairs.

466
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,760
I would think that I
in just a few seconds

467
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:29,200
-from the fact that I hear the strange
the sound in the cab until I catch up.

468
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,000
I do not think it took a minute even-

469
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:36,280
-until I got up
to the last floor of the ship.

470
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:42,280
When I get out of the ship
I do not see any people.

471
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:49,800
Where I stand there are no people.
I was one of the first to get there.

472
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:55,840
When I stand there
I look out to sea.

473
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,920
I look down and then I see
something strange in the water.

474
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,560
I see something white that is
several times several meters large.

475
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,440
Moving to the left.

476
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,400
This was moving.

477
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,840
I never did
military service.

478
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,680
I have no idea
what submarines look like in the water.

479
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,560
It was dark in the water.

480
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:31,480
I have no idea about a submarine
may look brighter than water.

481
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,040
But obviously
drove the ship on something

482
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:39,920
-for what is it that explains
that you hear sound

483
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,360
-which sounds like that ship
drive through ice

484
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:51,040
-when you are down there where you hear
everything that hits the ship?

485
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,040
With such big events
you have to be extra careful.

486
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,640
You have to be extra careful
with what you write and report

487
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,920
-and do not speculate.

488
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:14,600
When searching online
why Estonia sank

489
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,960
-you can find all possible
kind of conspiracy theories.

490
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,840
Some are very odd and unlikely.

491
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,680
Some claim that Arabs were behind it,
that Israel did

492
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,760
-or that it was about
drug smuggling that went awry.

493
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:33,320
This makes it difficult for serious on-call
nalister. Because when you hear

494
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,880
-clump together with the others
the conspiracy theorists.

495
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,080
No one knows what to believe.

496
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,280
But after researching
The 21-year-old Estonia accident

497
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,320
-I have come to this conclusion:

498
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,000
Estonia was used for transportation
important information-

499
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,960
-from Russia to the West.

500
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,760
It's about the Russian mafia,
smuggling-

501
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,920
and other criminal activity.

502
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,880
It was a collaboration between MI6-

503
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,680
Estonian intelligence service and
the Swedish intelligence service.

504
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:14,520
There were two clear warnings
from Russia to the West.

505
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:20,120
"We know what you're smuggling
aboard Estonia. "

506
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,840
"You have to stop, otherwise ..."
