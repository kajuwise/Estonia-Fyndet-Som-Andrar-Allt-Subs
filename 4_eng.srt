1
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,840
My name is Stephen Davis
and is a journalist.

2
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,360
I'm from New Zealand,
but I have worked all over the world.

3
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,080
I have explored many phenomena,
but they all have one thing in common:

4
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,040
Authorities, companies and influential
people who obscure things.

5
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,480
That which drives me
are the people you talk to

6
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,600
-which has been fed with lies
or have not received any

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,040
-and as desperate
searching for the truth.

8
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,800
It was obvious that the facts were obscured
in the aftermath of the Estonian disaster.

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,360
During my review of the incident-

10
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:08,360
-I discovered it existed
an agreement regarding the burial site.

11
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,240
All three governments,
Estonia, Finland and Sweden

12
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,280
-agree that we should
consider this a graveyard.

13
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:22,640
Because it's that way, it is
criminal to go down to the wreck.

14
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,480
The agreement was signed
of the countries around the Baltic

15
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,400
-as well as the UK, odd enough.

16
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,520
The UK is not located
on the Baltic Sea.

17
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,600
That's pretty weird
that they signed the agreement.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,600
I contacted the British to take
find out why the agreement was signed

19
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,320
-and got cold hand.

20
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,960
Why did the British sign an agreement?
that hindered the exploration of the ferry?

21
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,920
We'll take a closer look
on Richard Tomlinson.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,160
The boy from Ngruawhia who became
spy and ended up as a nationless.

23
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,720
He lives in exile in the south of France

24
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,320
-can not return to New Zealand,
and is wanted in the UK.

25
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,800
MY LIFE AS A SPY

26
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,000
Richard Tomlinson
was an MI6 agent who was fired

27
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,160
- under mysterious circumstances.

28
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,480
Are they afraid of what you can reveal?

29
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,760
The thing has grown bigger and bigger-

30
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:39,440
-in the media, the public
and, worse, the eyes of the police.

31
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,680
He carried many secrets,
but would he really reveal them?

32
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,080
But the British action
made him angry and upset

33
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,880
-and he had something
to tell me.

34
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,120
Tomlinson had a New Zealand passport.
He was born in New Zealand.

35
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,200
We arranged
so that he could go to Paris

36
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:09,680
-and fly to Auckland with his
New Zealand passport to meet me.

37
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,360
He said, "Did you know about this?"

38
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,080
He produced a document
and handed it to me.

39
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,240
It traded
on the sinking of Estonia.

40
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,280
"Do you know this?"
And I answered:

41
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,440
"Yes, I know that,
but are you really involved? "

42
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,720
He said, "You should check this out."

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,960
"We were involved
in a smuggling operation in Estonia. "

44
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,520
"There are hidden facts here,
and you should investigate. "

45
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,520
I asked if "we" meant MI6,
and he answered yes.

46
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,920
After 6.5 years in power confirmed
Mikhail Gorbachev resigned tonight.

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,920
The symbol of the Soviet regime was removed.

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,800
The red flag
was replaced by the Russian

49
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,560
- when Mikhail Gorbachev officially
became the last leader of the Soviet Union.

50
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,200
I was lucky enough to grow up
at the same time-

51
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,640
-as Estonia
regained its independence.

52
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,000
It was like a fever.
People were euphoric.

53
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:23,240
The most symbol-laden event
was the formation of the human chain.

54
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,520
The chain started in Tallinn and stretched
all the way to the capital of Lithuania.

55
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,720
To call it a big event
is an understatement.

56
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:57,400
It's called the singing
revolution because of the mass rallies

57
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:04,400
-under which hundreds of thousands
people sang together.

58
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,040
We had recaptured our place
on the map and was taken seriously.

59
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,840
We had regained power
over our own country.

60
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,360
In 1991 I was appointed Swedish

61
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,040
-and not only Sweden's, but it
the very first ambassador to Estonia

62
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,560
-which a few days before had
restored its independence.

63
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,520
The country was dependent on ferry traffic.

64
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,560
Demand, both
at passenger and car seats-

65
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,680
-became bigger than you could offer.

66
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:59,240
A new ship was needed, and
it was named after Estonia.

67
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,240
The ship was absolutely crucial to that
Estonia got up so quickly.

68
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:17,400
Many people had their first meeting
with the Western world aboard Estonia.

69
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:26,000
Many saw oysters and pineapples
for the first time on the buffet table.

70
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,080
They boarded the Estonia

71
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,080
and at the same time stepped into the western world
and capitalist society.

72
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,960
That ship
was named after Estonia, Estonia-

73
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,040
-shows how important the ship was
for Estonia.

74
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,880
After
the liberation of the Baltic States

75
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,560
- the Soviet bases were wound up.

76
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,480
That meant a lot of weapons
and military materiel

77
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,480
-of Soviet and Russian origin
would suddenly be moved-

78
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,840
-and very much came into operation.

79
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,360
It was described as the "Wild West".

80
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,640
It was sold, it was bought,
it was taken out of the country.

81
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,400
There was no control over
where the weapons and materiel went.

82
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,679
The situation was that
that Swedish and Western interests

83
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:40,120
-also was looking to get over
the Soviet systems and weapons.

84
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,120
When the Estonians became independent

85
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:56,920
they wondered how long freedom would last
persisted and asked the western world for help.

86
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,760
They wanted the western world to
protect them from Russia.

87
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,320
They prioritized formation
of a good intelligence service.

88
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:16,400
They asked MI6 for help with the establishment
of this new intelligence service.

89
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,120
MI6 has had strong ties for a long time
the Swedish intelligence service.

90
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,840
Therefore, it was natural that Sweden
and Estonia cooperated with MI6.

91
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,200
Equipment was shipped from Russia
across the border into Estonia.

92
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,120
It was taken to the port, loaded
on ships and shipped to Sweden.

93
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,760
It was a very successful route
which was used for many years.

94
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,280
The Estonian flagged passenger ferry
Estonia with 867 people on board

95
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,840
-sunk last night, southwest of Finnish Utö.

96
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,280
Estonia capsized and sank on some
few minutes. How could this happen?

97
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,880
On the same day that Estonia sank

98
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,480
it was rumored that the ferry was being used
to smuggle munitions.

99
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,680
It was dismissed
as pure conspiracy theories.

100
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:34,840
The load can be impossible
have had anything to do with the accident.

101
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,080
I already understood there and then
that if it was possible to

102
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,560
-that Estonia had been used to
smuggle secret military equipment

103
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,440
- probably Soviet equipment,
that would be an incredibly big deal.

104
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,240
For the tenth anniversary of the accident, I got
an email from Lennart Henriksson-

105
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,440
-who had been head of customs in Värtan.

106
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,160
Estonia and other ferries arrived.
He had something to tell.

107
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,000
A few weeks before the accident
he was called to his boss.

108
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,400
Together they had gone to the boss
for the customs region here in Stockholm.

109
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,800
The boss said:

110
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:51,080
"There will be some cars like you
shall be admitted without inspection. "

111
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,880
"Do not visit? Who said that?"

112
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,960
"It's an order," I received
in response. "From the highest place."

113
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,360
"As high as you can get."
"Is it from the king?"

114
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,920
"No, but it's very high up."

115
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:18,480
The first car arrived on September 14
- two weeks before the accident.

116
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:27,960
He got a call and they said:
"Now comes one of these cars."

117
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,720
He went down to the ferry terminal,
and the ferry came in.

118
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,040
He got to see which car did not
would check but looked in it anyway.

119
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,160
I said that the customs kept control. He
looked at me but asked no questions.

120
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,600
I said "I want to look a little in the car"
and opened some boxes.

121
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,800
As I understood it, it was
military electronics in the boxes.

122
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,480
On September 20, Henriksson said,
so this happened for the second time.

123
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,480
He was called. "There's one
another car to let you through. "

124
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,840
It was a larger car with a double
as large a load as the first

125
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,400
-but as he could see
so it was the same type of cargo.

126
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:32,600
He went on vacation, so when the accident
happened he was not in Stockholm.

127
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,400
So he does not know
if there was any cargo then, that night.

128
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,680
It had been rumored that it had been
military transport in Estonia.

129
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,760
But it had been unconfirmed.
Now I was sitting with a man in front of me-

130
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,400
-who could tell,
from his own experience-

131
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,800
-that it had happened,
and very close to the accident.

132
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,160
The weeks before the sinking of Estonia
just over ten years ago

133
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,360
-the ferry was used for secret shipping
of military equipment.

134
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,840
The speculations
proved to be true.

135
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,600
It is now confirmed that it has been shipped
military equipment on board Estonia.

136
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,400
The Armed Forces conducts operations
which is partly secret.

137
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,040
It's pretty natural
that we have such business.

138
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,200
This is part of such a
activity that I can not comment on.

139
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:27,280
We want to know what happened,
and we are as surprised as others

140
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,600
-of the news that steamed down the other day.

141
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,080
That's remarkable
and shocking.

142
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:39,320
Usually, transportation is bypassed
military equipment of rigorous rules.

143
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,280
But here the Armed Forces has used
of a civilian passenger ferry

144
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,120
-to carry military goods.

145
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,800
It is completely unacceptable to smuggle
munitions on a passenger ferry.

146
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,280
Civilians are then exposed
for an obvious danger.

147
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,520
It struck like a bomb in society.

148
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,080
The government appointed an inquiry for
to ascertain whether this had happened.

149
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,800
Always like us
from time to time, through the

150
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,880
-have heard this kind of statement,
always got them rejected.

151
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,480
That is why the government has decided
to summon Johan Hirschfeldt-

152
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,760
-give him the task of going through-

153
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:24,080
-all the month of September for
the accident year 1994 and thereby ascertain:

154
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,400
Has there been that type
of transports on board Estonia?

155
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,680
Mona Sahlin, who took care of
The Estonia issue, was very upset.

156
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,880
I interviewed her, and she showed
that this had shaken her.

157
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:44,320
That one had transported,
secretly, military equipment

158
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,840
-so close to the accident without the defense
had told something after the accident.

159
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,320
People had been sitting here
at customs and in the defense

160
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:59,200
-and knew things that were essential
for the investigation, for the relatives

161
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,720
-and did not say anything.

162
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,760
THE CURSE OF ESTONIA

163
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,320
The report raises questions
around the Estonian disaster

164
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:23,400
The interview with Lennart Henriksson
in Swedish television everything changed.

165
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,400
The rumors that had aroused
such a joke for ten years

166
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,240
-suddenly considered credible
and were no longer free fantasies.

167
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,240
WE HOPE FOR A NEW INVESTIGATION!

168
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,200
In 2005, the Estonian established
the government a Commission

169
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,120
-for the purpose of investigating the smuggling
of military equipment in Estonia.

170
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,840
I headed the Commission.

171
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:05,319
The Swedish authorities
first promised to cooperate with us.

172
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,440
But when we started going into details
concerning the covert operation

173
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,400
-they gave us conflicting information.

174
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,760
My conclusion was that the information
was not reliable.

175
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,839
We did not arrive
to especially much.

176
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:30,640
We did not manage to find out what it was
was the question of whether and where it came from.

177
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,200
It was largely due to
that the Swedish authorities

178
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,720
-not willing to cooperate.

179
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,160
It has been clarified that the Armed Forces

180
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:01,320
-at two occasions
during the month of September 1994-

181
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,400
-transported defense equipment
on M / S Estonia.

182
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,440
It took place on 14 and 20 September.

183
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,200
The equipment has passed
of electronic equipment

184
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,280
-no connection to weapon system-

185
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,920
and the equipment does not belong to anyone
part has been of an explosive nature.

186
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,400
Exactly what is classified, as well
from which country the equipment came.

187
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,720
Only the Minister of Defense
received that information today.

188
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,320
The information is scarce,
all with reference to confidentiality.

189
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,920
As for the night when Estonia sank
it is said that no

190
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,120
-which indicates that the Armed Forces
transported something.

191
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,200
I feel confident in that.

192
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,760
But you see how I am
has formulated me in the paper.

193
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,360
"They gave me no reason to assume
that they sought to transport equipment. "

194
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,040
What Hirschfeldt came to the conclusion was that
transports Henriksson told about

195
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,200
-the 14th and 20th of September
had taken place

196
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,480
-and it was the Swedish defense
who had stood for them.

197
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,280
He also showed that there was no indication

198
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,720
-that the defense had had
any transport on the night of the accident.

199
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,640
It was an incredible disappointment.
I felt that too.

200
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,520
It was like nothing came of it all.
The whole thing was swept under the carpet.

201
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,080
- despite what I had perceived
from Mona Sahlin:

202
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,880
That she was very interested
of going to the bottom with this.

203
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,880
Hirschfeldt has been known for
to have a good memory

204
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,720
and his investigation
was very short and limited.

205
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,440
When we had a hearing in the Riksdag
a few weeks later-

206
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,680
-so we asked the question
how the ordering had taken place.

207
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,200
Who ordered the customs officer
to let through the contraband?

208
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,000
Hirschfeldt said he had nothing
memory of it. He did not remember.

209
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,000
When we asked about the background material
which are not included in the report itself

210
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,960
- he said he had burned up
the background material.

211
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,680
-The background material is not preserved.
-Why not?

212
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,000
I chose not to report anything like that.
I chose to present the report.

213
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,720
For what reasons does not exist
the background material left?

214
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,640
I came to the conclusion that it was on it
the manner in which the mission was to be carried out.

215
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,920
As far as I know, it has never happened
in Swedish administrative history

216
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,400
-that a state investigation
destroys its background material.

217
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,560
There is nothing to perceive:
"Maybe you should destroy it!"

218
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,280
Someone has to explicitly say, "Everything
background material shall be destroyed. "

219
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,080
What was done
clearly showed that the Armed Forces

220
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,280
- had no interest in
to reach on this issue.

221
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,920
No private companies were investigated
been involved-

222
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,120
-or other countries
intelligence services.

223
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,360
They did not find out anything-

224
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,280
-so Hirschfeldt's investigation is correct,
but it is completely uninteresting.

225
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,560
It just confirmed
what the customs official had acknowledged

226
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,080
-but it did not find out anything else.

227
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,800
In the new Baltics
so prevailed the Wild West mood

228
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,200
-with weapons and all sorts of things-

229
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,800
-which was sold and bought
and was expelled from the land.

230
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,640
One who experienced this situation-

231
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,600
-was the Swedish military attaché on
that time in the Baltics:Sören Lindman.

232
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:59,640
There may have been goods in Russia
carried across the border into Estonia

233
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,240
-and shipped on to Sweden,
perhaps without the knowledge of the authorities.

234
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,200
He did not know the transports as
happened with Estonia shortly before the accident.

235
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,080
He concluded that it was not

236
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:19,000
the normal intelligence service
who had organized the transports.

237
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,200
It must have been organized
of the most secretive

238
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,240
-of the Swedish
military intelligence.

239
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,800
The regular intelligence service
activities he would have known.

240
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,960
But he did not.
It must have been KSI.

241
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,520
Special Collection Office:
Sweden's secret spy organization.

242
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,800
That explains the incredible
confidentiality of transport

243
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,240
-if KSI was involved.

244
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,920
Nothing was allowed to come out
reveal details about KSI's operations.

245
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,800
- Did you work with them?
-I know they were there.

246
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,520
But cooperation or not?
I leave that open.

247
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,680
Did you help them get equipment?

248
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,800
I do not answer that question.

249
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,840
-1994 we are talking about now. September 1994.
-Yes.

250
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,920
- Did you help them with equipment?
-I do not answer that question.

251
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,840
The Estonia accident is surrounded by such
a lot of secrecy and stamps.

252
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,480
It must, as I see it,
indicate that you are

253
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,840
-for what the truth should turn out to be.

254
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,680
What I can say with certainty
has happened during these 25 years-

255
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:48,280
-since the night of the sinking is that
authorities do not want to find out

256
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,480
-what was on board Estonias
cargo deck during the night of sinking.

257
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,680
The biggest question mark
touch the photos taken on October 2nd.

258
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,680
Four days after the sinking.

259
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,920
The pictures show that the railings
on the boarding ramp ...

260
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,760
They are sawn off
outside the ship on the seabed.

261
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,680
Here's something
which is very, very wrong.

262
00:24:53,560 --> 00:25:00,280
I thought about it a lot
why the railings were outside the ship.

263
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,320
They show that someone has tried
get on the cargo deck. Why?

264
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,280
Just a defense force
can act so powerfully-

265
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,760
-and get in
on a ship's cargo deck.

266
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,680
The only thing that can motivate
such an action is if there are

267
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:24,160
-a state affairs or military
urgent cargo on board. Nothing else.

268
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,760
In these interpellation debates
which I took the initiative

269
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:43,120
- I hoped to be able to push forward answers
and pursue further investigation.

270
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,320
You should be able to trust
on its Armed Forces.

271
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,240
You should be able to trust your government.

272
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,240
That they do their utmost
in a situation like this.

273
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,240
If you can not do that, then something is
fundamental flaws in society.

274
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,160
Thank you, Madam President. It is
very clear images showing

275
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,560
-that someone has cut off
on-board ramp

276
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,440
-something of the next 24 hours
after the sinking.

277
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,680
This is actual evidence for
activities that we do not know

278
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,400
-and which has not happened
under the direction of the Accident Investigation Board.

279
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,240
Why has the Prime Minister not found
it is important to find the answer to:

280
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,040
What are these?

281
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,720
What kind of activities do they have
participated in, and what was the purpose?

282
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,240
Thanks. - Minister of Public Works.

283
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,760
The subtitle all the time
when Ångström expresses

284
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,760
- is that here is a minister
which would deliberately conceal truths.

285
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,920
It does not matter how many
times I look him in the eye-

286
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,240
-and says:"That's not me."

287
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,800
I do not know if
some other dives - point.

288
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,160
Absolutely no other dives. Against
in the light of what I have stated here-

289
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,200
- I do not think so
there are sufficient reasons

290
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,200
-to allow underwater-
operations at the wreck of M / S Estonia-

291
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,680
-and no reason either
to take measures in connection with

292
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:04,200
-of any activity
around the wreck of M / S Estonia.

293
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,320
The Prime Minister's response to the interpellation
about not doing anything-

294
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,920
-gives the impression, for many,
that the government participates in

295
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,160
-to obscure the circumstances
and the activities of the Armed Forces

296
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,200
-in connection with the sinking of Estonia,
and it does not feel good.

297
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,360
Even a non-answer can be an answer.

298
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,640
If you do not want to investigate
so maybe that says something too.

299
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,520
Everything indicates that the Swedish
The Armed Forces is aware of

300
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,120
-about the intrusion on the cargo deck between
on September 28 and October 2.

301
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,520
Why one can only speculate,
but it presupposes something-

302
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,920
-which is of great state
or military interest.

303
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,720
I'm convinced that the truth about
what was on Estonia's cargo deck

304
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,960
-is an issue as well
will get an answer.

305
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:19,560
The basis of my contacts within
various intelligence services are simple:

306
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,520
They know they can trust me.

307
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,440
Tomlinson told about the smuggling
aboard Estonia 1998-

308
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:33,480
-which was six years before the Swedish
the customs official's TV revealed.

309
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:40,920
I was sitting in a hotel room in Auckland
to make a different kind of story-

310
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,920
-when I suddenly got information
on a ferry sinking in the Baltic Sea

311
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,440
and a smuggling operation
which involved MI6.

312
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:58,600
I immediately decided
to get to the bottom of that story.

313
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,600
Further investigations
led me to a new source.

314
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:13,160
An MI6 agent on active duty gave me
information about what actually happened.

315
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,440
Russia had, on two occasions,
demanded that the countries of the

316
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,120
- would stop the smuggling.

317
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,720
The first requirement reached Estonia in 1993
via diplomatic channels.

318
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:32,680
They knew about the smuggling on the ferry
and ordered Estonia to stop.

319
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,960
Estonia ignored the demand.

320
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:43,560
The following year, just before the sinking,
Russia turned directly to MI6.

321
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:49,240
"We know about smuggling, and we know
that it takes place on board Estonia. "

322
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,120
"Stop this immediately. Otherwise ..."

323
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:13,120
While Swedes and Estonians
mourned their dead

324
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,280
-who followed the ferry to the bottom of the sea-

325
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:21,120
- there was panic behind
intelligence lantern doors.

326
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:31,920
Sweden has acknowledged the smuggling on board
in Estonia in the weeks before the accident.

327
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000
However, my sources have confirmed that
smuggling took place during the night of the accident.

328
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:46,240
The contraband was critical information
on the Russian missile program

329
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,040
as well as electronic parts
linked to the missile program.

330
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:57,560
A high-ranking person
within the Swedish intelligence service

331
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,960
-must have said to the Prime Minister:

332
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:05,360
"You intend to salvage the ferry
to investigate the accident. "

333
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,720
"It absolutely must not happen."

334
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:41,600
Everything was very careless. Customs and
border guards barely existed.

335
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:46,120
You could carry what you wanted
wherever.

336
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:54,200
The investigation files I
came into contact with within the police

337
00:31:54,280 --> 00:32:01,560
-confirmed that the public
version of the accident presented

338
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,320
- is by no means true.

339
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,920
When I got on board
I put my things away.

340
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,640
I put down my bag
and walked around a bit on the boat.

341
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,720
Then I understand
that the boat is delayed.

342
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,320
I'm looking at the clock,
and the boat is late by now.

343
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:33,160
Then I go out on deck and think
that I might have time to wave to Dad.

344
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,160
This is how I look over the parking lot.

345
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,280
There are barrier bands set up. I
think they were rebuilding.

346
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,200
One more explanation
why Estonia was delayed

347
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,480
-where there were two or three
trucks to the port

348
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,800
-which was alleged to come
from the Estonian Home Guard

349
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,560
-or people attached to the Home Guard.

350
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,800
There was a commotion.
The police did not want to let them on board.

351
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:12,360
The others, that is, the Home Guard,
which came with the cargo-

352
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,560
-did not give up.

353
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,120
I see that there will be a transport.

354
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:25,720
There are two or three motorcycles,
or four, which runs fairly fast.

355
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:31,440
They escort military vehicles
who rides on the boat.

356
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:38,080
I perceived it as it was
at least two, but there may have been more.

357
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:43,080
They were painted green
because they were military

358
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:48,080
-but it was also a car
with a rather large box on.

359
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:53,440
Or a flatbed with one like that
tarpaulin on, or something.

360
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:01,800
In short,
what was on board the trucks?

361
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,320
On the two, or three trucks,
there are different offers for the

362
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,600
- military technology was shipped.

363
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,199
Military electronics.

364
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,440
There was talk
on top-secret military technology

365
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,400
-which was brand new at the time.

366
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,440
Within the Russian military it is
much that is classified.

367
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:34,000
It's so secret
that if something is lost-

368
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:39,199
-or left
in foreign territories

369
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:46,199
- you do everything to destroy it
so it does not end up in the wrong hands.

370
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,159
When they're on, we go. You close
again, and then it's ready for departure.

371
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:03,680
I think, 'That's why we were
delayed. "The vehicles were waiting.

372
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,480
It's weird that it's military
vehicles on a passenger ship.

373
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,280
That which gets me
to think it's weird-

374
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,760
- was precisely this information
which emerged many years later.

375
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:26,400
That it was military transport
in Estonia, but not just that night.

376
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,600
But I saw that it was.

377
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,000
There must have been many who saw it.

378
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,480
There were others standing on deck.

379
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:42,720
The staff at the terminal and those who
worked on the boat must know about it.

380
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:09,960
I never thought of a journalist
from Sweden would find me-

381
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,520
-but they found me.

382
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,240
My name is Kadir Kaymaz.

383
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:31,680
When the accident occurred
I was Carl Övberg.

384
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,880
Estonia 1994 was ...

385
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,400
You could say chaos.

386
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,680
You could buy
all old Russian military stuff.

387
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,000
Even helicopters.

388
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,880
I sold cars to Estonia.

389
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,200
I went with the boat several times.
Maybe twenty.

390
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,640
But this evening
was a little different.

391
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:29,120
I went from the center of Tallinn to
the port by taxi. I was in a hurry.

392
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:38,480
But when we got to the port area
were the military there.

393
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,200
The military police stopped the taxi.

394
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,360
Taxi drivers
dropped me off outside the harbor.

395
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,240
I ran to the boat.

396
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,600
I was the last passenger.

397
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:04,440
When I looked down in front of the boat
I saw some military cars.

398
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:10,600
Military activity.
Almost ten, fifteen soldiers.

399
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:17,240
And military vehicles
with chapel and such red candles.

400
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:23,280
That's when I thought:
Maybe something's going on.

401
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:38,040
I have no evidence,
but I think they smuggled weapons

402
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:43,640
-or
any technical military equipment ...

403
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,200
... from the former Soviet Union.

404
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:04,080
When I came back to Stockholm
called my phone

405
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:10,440
-and there was a guy who said:
"Do not come to Estonia."

406
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:17,240
It was threatening,
so I stopped going to Estonia.

407
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:31,600
Maybe they did not like
my observations.

408
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:49,040
There are still many questions
which are unanswered around Estonia.

409
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:55,600
Why not confirm the authorities
military transport in Estonia?

410
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,840
I was a witness
to this event.

411
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:12,600
If Estonia had military cargo, it has
had consequences for the investigation.

412
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,920
That explains why
they wanted to cast the ship in concrete.

413
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,680
You did not enter the cargo deck
and controlled the load.

414
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,400
The ship's was not inspected
hull. Whether it had been damaged.

415
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,120
As you continue
to prevent further investigation

416
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,480
- we will not come
with one hundred percent security

417
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,960
-to be able to determine
the cause of the sinking.

418
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:48,040
It's just by going down and
inspect the appearance of the shipwreck

419
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:52,720
-as one can reach clarity,
and the government does not agree.

420
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,440
About the management of Estonia
shall meet the requirements

421
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,560
-how a state governed by the rule of law
such a huge accident

422
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:16,080
- so the authorities must do
the measures proposed

423
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,720
-to examine the ferry
where it is located

424
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,200
-and see what answers you can find, there
down, on what caused the accident.

425
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:37,960
To send divers down again to
examine the ferry more closely would be good.

426
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,880
With today's technology
maybe we can get answers.

427
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:48,240
It takes new dives to find
the truth. The sooner, the better.

428
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:01,800
The Finnish Maritime Administration
announced that they

429
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,400
-that the peace of the tomb over Estonia
out in the Baltic Sea has been broken.

430
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:13,320
You also suspect
that a diving robot has been sent down.

431
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,240
The truth about what happened
with Estonia is hidden in the Baltic Sea.

432
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:26,080
A diving expedition is required
to find out what happened.

433
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,800
The diving robot
has visual contact with the wreck.

434
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:39,000
-What the hell?
-Oh, fucking. Oh, fucking!
