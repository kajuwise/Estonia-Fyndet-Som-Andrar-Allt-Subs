1
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,280
I'm thinking about how lucky I was
who managed to get me out of there.

2
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,960
Everything feels so much more authentic
and you value everything much more

3
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,720
-when you have almost lost your life.

4
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,080
I still do not understand why
the ship was not properly inspected.

5
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,760
Think about how slowly the Titanic sank

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,920
-and how fast Estonia sank.

7
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,560
I want an answer. What was that
what happened, and why did it happen?

8
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,800
I get no peace
until I get an answer.

9
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,880
My wish as a survivor is
that we are getting closer to the truth.

10
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,920
And I think
that the truth is something else-

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,280
-than what has
served the people so far.

12
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,840
I do not believe it was just
a bow visor that broke.

13
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,120
If that is the explanation one would
do not want to cover the ship with

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,880
and one would not ban
the filming of the ship.

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,200
Here we have a ferry that has sunk.

16
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,360
To date, it has not been investigated
if the hull was complete when she sank.

17
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,360
How could the ship sink?

18
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,040
-without a hole that let out air
from the bottom of the ship?

19
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,320
The ship did not sink for no reason.
There must be a hole.

20
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,440
It's so easy
to just go down and check.

21
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,720
You do not know
if it really was an accident.

22
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,840
In fact, it can
be something else that happened out there.

23
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:22,240
If you want to move on, you have to
make new dives down to Estonia's wreck.

24
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,200
We started from Rostock and set course
north, towards the wreck site.

25
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,920
The trip takes a little over two days.

26
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,360
Today is D-Day, and I think
that everyone has been looking forward to this.

27
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,240
Now it's finally time.

28
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,160
We will be in place
around five o'clock this afternoon.

29
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:11,600
The area around the sinking site, and
even the wreck, is protected by the peace of the grave.

30
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,160
This makes diving on the wreck difficult.

31
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,600
Previous expeditions
have encountered major problems.

32
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,600
What are your intentions? Come on.

33
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,080
My name is Jakob Olszewski.

34
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,200
I was a diver during the previous two
expeditions to the Estonian wreck.

35
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,920
This time
I am a diving consultant.

36
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,600
The boat is German flagged and Germany has
not written under the Tomb Peace Act.

37
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,600
This is international waters,
but we do not know what will happen.

38
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,520
Oh!

39
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,360
It looks like
there is a military ship

40
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,680
-just above our goal.

41
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,520
Above the wreck of Estonia.

42
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,320
They're waiting for us.

43
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,240
They were also present
at the two previous expeditions-

44
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,320
-so I expect no problems.

45
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,880
But you can never be completely sure.

46
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,960
When we can read the text
on the ship side-

47
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:49,600
-so we see that it is the Finnish coast-
the guard's largest ship Turva.

48
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,840
Turva has placed itself on top of the wreck.

49
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,560
If they do not move
then we can not dive.

50
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,400
Turva, Turva,
this is M / S Fritz Reuter.

51
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,800
Fritz Reuter, Turva who answers.

52
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,480
I have a question:

53
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,280
Are you going to stay in your position,
or can you move?

54
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,640
I see that you are approaching spring
position. What are your intentions?

55
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,160
We are a documentary team

56
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,800
-who makes a documentary
about the Estonian disaster.

57
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:50,680
I understand. Do you intend to
engage in underwater activities?

58
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,480
Yes.

59
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,040
In that case, I must inform you of the

60
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,720
-that the wreck is considered a burial site
for all who died in the accident.

61
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,360
We are aware of that,
but we sail under the German flag.

62
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,800
That is why I think we should
be able to carry out our assignment.

63
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,560
A last question:

64
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:44,800
Has nine people of Finnish, Swedish
or Estonian nationality on board?

65
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,960
We have two Swedes on board.

66
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,280
Turva, this is Fritz Reuter.

67
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,560
Did you understand
that we are a German-flagged ship

68
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,120
-which is on international waters?

69
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,120
Turve here.

70
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,679
Yes, it is understood.

71
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,159
And with regard to maritime safety
are we prepared to move-

72
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,600
- half a mile away
from this position.

73
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,520
So good. Thanks so much.

74
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,160
Wow! This is great!

75
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,920
I did say
that the pimples are really nice.

76
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,040
Thank you, Finland!

77
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,880
When Turva chooses to move
we feel a great relief.

78
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,680
But they remained in place
and observed us all the time.

79
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,720
In order to have a reference on the sea surface

80
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,480
-then you have to throw out a shot line,
or a dive line.

81
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,520
It is incredibly important that the diving line
hits as close to the wreck as possible.

82
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,720
We have to move the dive line.

83
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,760
Launch the ROV, please.

84
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,680
ROV launched.

85
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,000
Thanks.

86
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,400
Okay, drive towards the dive line.

87
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,680
Turn the ROV 90 degrees to the left.

88
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,440
90 degrees to the left, please.

89
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,640
We have not yet
visual contact with the diving line.

90
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:04,040
-Okay, now I see it.
-We have visual contact with the diving line.

91
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,000
-I'm starting to dive.
-Thank you, we're starting to dive.

92
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,440
We are now five meters below the water surface.

93
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,080
Celebrate more diving line.

94
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,680
The diving line is amidships,
25 meters away.

95
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,360
The Finnish Maritime Administration announces
in a press release

96
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:32,280
-that they believe the peace of the grave over the wreck
Estonia out in the Baltic Sea has been broken.

97
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,440
You also suspect
that a diving robot has been sent down

98
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,360
- despite calls not to do so,
and despite the fact that there is grave peace.

99
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,640
We have Petteri Partanen with us
from the Finnish Maritime Administration.

100
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,800
-Has anyone been arrested?
-No.

101
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,320
We have no legal powers
in international waters.

102
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,120
- Are you monitoring the ship?
-Yes, uninterrupted.

103
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:12,280
I hope it is a good sight
down there. We're going down to 70 meters.

104
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,760
60 meters.
We should start approaching.

105
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,240
Pretty much jellyfish.

106
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,360
We are now down to a depth of 67 meters.

107
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:47,280
Okay, when we get down we get
hope it's ... Well, there.

108
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,600
The ROV has visual contact
with the wreck.

109
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:58,440
The diving line is perfectly placed
between us and Turva. It looks good.

110
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,840
It is located directly between the bow thrusters.

111
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,120
The diving line is located between the bow thrusters.

112
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,760
We'll get out on the bulb here.

113
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,200
Around 73 meters deep on the bulb.

114
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,320
The ROV has visual contact
with Estonia's bulb.

115
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,080
The bow looks nice.

116
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,240
Celebrate more diving line
calm and careful, thank you.

117
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,520
Celebrate more diving line.

118
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,280
We follow the fender on the port side-

119
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,960
-in western direction.

120
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,240
Roger.

121
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:29,640
-What's that?
-Wait. Now we'll see here ...

122
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,840
This must be the hole
as the Rockwater divers did in 1994.

123
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,560
In December 1994, they made two holes,
so we should find another one over here.

124
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,280
Yes, and here's the second hole.

125
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,720
I now have good documentation
of the two Rockwater holes.

126
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,600
Roger.

127
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:27,240
Rockwater would cover the holes
when finished, but it is open.

128
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,120
But it may have been done later.

129
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,800
-Now I'm driving back.
-ROB returns to the dive line.

130
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:59,000
It seems to have tipped over a lot.
It is at quite an angle.

131
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,520
The ship appears to have
quite strong tilt-

132
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,080
- towards starboard side.

133
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,680
I would guess at about 130 degrees.

134
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,960
Is Turva still in position?

135
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,480
Can you go starboard out?

136
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,200
I go out and walk around the line again,
and then we go down and go aft.

137
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,119
Celebrate more dive line, please.

138
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,599
Celebrate more diving line.

139
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,160
-This must be the fender.
-Is it starboard fender?

140
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,400
The ROV is located
at Estonia's starboard fender.

141
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,080
We follow it aft.

142
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,600
-Fire down.
-Provides more diving line.

143
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:53,000
There are rumors of a hole that explains
why the boat sinks so fast.

144
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,480
We do not know if it has been filmed before.

145
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:04,960
This is the first review of
possible damage to that part of the boat.

146
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:17,680
-You can see quite well.
-Yes, now we are at 85 meters deep.

147
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:31,640
There is quite a lot of color left. She
is completely white above the blue fender.

148
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,680
This looks like mud.
It's Baltic clay.

149
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:49,640
-Here we have ... Yes, that's rock.
-The line is now 40 meters from the stern.

150
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,960
Yes, this
must be the filling stone.

151
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,880
It's just there, as well.

152
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:15,720
But if you follow the fender further now
then we have it as a reference.

153
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,680
Wait.

154
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,960
Now we'll see here ...

155
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,600
-Are you already in ...?
-There, turn there.

156
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,760
Where the hell are we now?
The boat ends here.

157
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,800
Oops, look!

158
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,960
That looks like a ... No.

159
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:01,200
I'll see if I can get a better one
Angle. I was a little surprised.

160
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,680
Is it the fender?

161
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,880
Can you try to come
so you see ...? Can you see in?

162
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,680
Oh, fucking!

163
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,440
It is completely imprinted here.

164
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:30,080
-Now I look straight into the boat.
-It is therefore completely inflated.

165
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,480
Yes, up on the starboard side
is it fully depressed, like one meter.

166
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,360
The fender is completely mashed.

167
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,800
-Oh oh oh!
-Yes, it's a ...

168
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,520
I'll see if I can
can get a little down to the side.

169
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,840
I'm coming across the sandbank behind,
so I have to get up and go over a bit.

170
00:20:53,920 --> 00:21:00,320
There we are above the fender. It is
something around there, like an o or an s.

171
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,480
There you see it. It really looks
looks like something's written there.

172
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,400
An s or an o.
Something with a round bottom edge.

173
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,400
Estonia was not on the sidelines.

174
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,040
No, it said Estline,
so it can be the bottom of a s.

175
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:28,080
There's a towel. I do not know
if we are at the "swimming pool area".

176
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,960
I think we're further behind.

177
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:36,240
If we are at the s on Estline
are we further back.

178
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,440
-But how could they have missed that?
-They can not if they have dived here.

179
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,400
-The diving line is amidships.
-ROB is a midshipman in Estonia.

180
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:53,600
We have made an interesting discovery
and stops at this position.

181
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,560
Roger.

182
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,760
-There the fender is fully pressed.
-The dive line is directly above the wreck.

183
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,880
But is this from ...?
Is it from the sinking itself?

184
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,520
-She kind of got out of the water.
-I'm checking again.

185
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,280
I've seen a lot of wrecks.

186
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,720
It seems to be
really a lot of power in this one.

187
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:27,320
-Here it is ...
-It is steel beams that have fallen off.

188
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:33,520
The hull is completely blown out here, of course.
It points out a large piece of metal here.

189
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:40,200
This is a very clear,
and very large, damage.

190
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,800
It's hard to get a better angle.
It feels a little insecure.

191
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,720
Things stand out here, but I do
try to get as close as possible.

192
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,160
But look at this, then!

193
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,520
-It's a hole.
-Any big.

194
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,440
It does not look like
as it has only been a "tension".

195
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,600
It is completely pressed.

196
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,520
Which side did she lean on
when she sank?

197
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,800
She leans towards starboard.

198
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,000
-It's starboard side we're looking at.
-Yes, and I mean, it's like ...

199
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,560
Would it be a hole somewhere
in the boat it would be here.

200
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:39,480
-It's long too. Really long.
-Oh oh oh!

201
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,160
- Are you having an abortion now?
-Yes, we go to the surface.

202
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,000
Celebrate the dive line.
We take the ROV to the surface.

203
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,480
We get to watch the 4K video as well,
but it was an injury we saw there.

204
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,760
-The fender was completely off.
-Yes Yes.

205
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,480
At first I thought we were there
the stern, because the boat just ran out.

206
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,520
-Covers the diving line.
-I take it slow.

207
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600
Fucking!

208
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:27,280
A little after twelve, then it slams,
two very powerful bangs.

209
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,400
It sounds like we're going through ice.

210
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,480
Pretty soon after that, the ship does
a maneuver violently to starboard.

211
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,720
It was as if the ship
was hit by something.

212
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:50,200
Then all the glass in the cafeteria was smashed
behind me. It did not feel good.

213
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:57,040
Are you coming to the rescue?
It looks very bad here now!

214
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,040
I am very pleased that we,
after a few days-

215
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,760
-really can say that we have done
a groundbreaking find.

216
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:35,480
We have found damage.
Very large damage.

217
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:41,720
This can not be dismissed as
speculations. The damage is there.

218
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:55,280
A German-flagged ship is suspected of having
disturbed the peace of the grave around M / S Estonia.

219
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:01,560
The Finnish Maritime Administration
believe that the purpose was to photograph the wreck.

220
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,200
-You take the incident seriously.
-Such things like this should not happen.

221
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:13,680
You should not dive with anyone
appliances, without leaving the area alone.

222
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,080
Finnish Maritime Surveillance
have had contact with the ship.

223
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,880
There are Swedish citizens on board,
but you do not know who they are.

224
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:33,160
Once we have documented the damage
there were helicopters and planes.

225
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,960
We ended the operation.

226
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,120
What happens now?

227
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:49,080
We cooperate with Finnish
and international authorities.

228
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,680
We observe the ship's activities
very carefully.

229
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,280
Two Swedes are accused of having
desecrated Estonia's grave

230
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:05,760
On Saturday, it is 25 years since Estonia
fell. 852 people died in the accident.

231
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,200
Twenty-five years ago, I survived
M / S Estonia's sinking.

232
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,400
I got to come home to my family
and live on.

233
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:55,680
Thousands of other people watched
not parts of his family again.

234
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,600
It was a tough night, but it
was also difficult to live on.

235
00:27:59,680 --> 00:27:05,080
To be a survivor. A witness.
I could not stand the

236
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,560
-how we survivors and relatives
were not listened to.

237
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,080
That our testimonies were not counted

238
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,720
and relatives were not allowed to join
and make important decisions.

239
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,200
How could a country like Sweden
act that way?

240
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,080
To me, it was incomprehensible.

241
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,160
Unfortunately
the handling still affects us.

242
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,320
The decisions that were made
or not understood

243
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:35,920
-is like rings on the water
and reproduces indefinitely.

244
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,480
Today my thoughts go to all of you
who lost your loved ones that night

245
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,720
-other survivors-

246
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,960
-and to all my fellow passengers
who never got to come home again.

247
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,760
Several of those who spoke
at the memorial service

248
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,960
brought the claim
on a new, independent investigation.

249
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,120
Look at all the facts on the table.
Come to the logical conclusion-

250
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,240
-to appoint an independent
international inquiry.

251
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,360
Let's escape
all conspiracy theories.

252
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,920
The Ministry of Justice declared,
the same evening, in a press release

253
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
-that the government opposed
a new, independent inquiry.

254
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,360
Same day night.

255
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,520
We're on our way to Linus Andersson,
who was out on the Baltic Sea.

256
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,800
He is trained in ship technology

257
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,080
-and one of the Nordic countries
leading experts on wreck damage.

258
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,800
He has analyzed the material
from Estonia.

259
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,640
We will see for the first time
what he has found.

260
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,560
In the pictures and films I have-

261
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,680
managed to get the position out of the injury
on the wreck and the size of the damage.

262
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:43,640
As we can see from this 3D model
then we have the damage at this point.

263
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,720
It is definitely no small injury.

264
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,800
Can you explain
how we drove on the Baltic Sea?

265
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,960
When we arrived
we put down the diving line.

266
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,600
The diving line ends up perfectly
here at the bow, between the trustees.

267
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,280
Then we went up along the hull
to the fender.

268
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,600
So we have some kind of reference point.

269
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:17,800
The ROV drives on
about a third of the stern

270
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,120
-where we saw this injury.

271
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,480
Something I have noticed when I have
checked various drawings are-

272
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,720
-that the Estline text
have been to different places.

273
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:36,280
I have not used the text,
but of rows of windows and windows.

274
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:41,120
These are fixed points
where they should be on the drawings.

275
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:48,160
In this model we only see
the opening in the hull itself.

276
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,040
Where it is open into the boat.

277
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,040
How far is it from here to there?

278
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:01,600
It can continue longer,
but the minimum measurement is four meters.

279
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:16,480
Four meters in reality. If we
see how high it is in the ceiling here ...

280
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:25,840
-It is 2.5 m to the roof in here.
-So the damage continues for another 1.5 m.

281
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,200
-Fuck, it's big.
-Really big.

282
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:33,320
And 1.5 meters at the widest point.

283
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:39,080
The distance from the outside of the curtain
and here corresponds to the width of the damage.

284
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,240
And 1.5 meters higher than the ceiling.
Really big.

285
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:52,400
-Where is the damage we have observed?
-The damage is here.

286
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,400
Over here. So it's ...
Here we have a shot. Do you see?

287
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:03,000
To an untrained eye, it looks like
it is where people lie and sleep.

288
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,200
In the middle of the night
it's full of people in the cabins.

289
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,280
It's in the middle of the passengers.

290
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,640
This feels
as an impact injury to me.

291
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,440
As it is printed here ...
A force has really mashed the

292
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:25,360
-and made it fold twice.
And as it looks there ...

293
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:33,400
So. It's almost exactly that fender
lies here - weight over himself.

294
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,440
The question is
how and when it has arisen.

295
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,720
The Meyer shipyard that built Estonia
claims that there were

296
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:54,240
-more explosive charges on board
which detonated during the disaster.

297
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,480
Someone placed,
according to the yard's experts

298
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:02,920
explosives on board Estonia,
which detonated as the boat sank.

299
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,920
According to the report, it is likely

300
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,679
-that the damage in certain areas
has been caused by explosions.

301
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:20,719
German experts discovered that two, three
explosions caused holes in the hull.

302
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:29,480
There was a loud bang, and so on
another, whereupon the ship heeled.

303
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:37,239
This indicates explosions.

304
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,960
-Henrik.
-Frank.

305
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,680
My name is Frank Børresen
and is the war captain.

306
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,080
I work as a staff officer
for diving operations.

307
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,080
I have seen
a large number of explosions

308
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,360
-and how they affect
motor vehicles and ships.

309
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,640
I'm an expert on clearing
of explosive objects, diving

310
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,400
-as well as marine mine action.

311
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,200
Yes, there I see the damage begins.

312
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,200
What is characteristic here
is that it is very elongated.

313
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:59,880
-Can you see the distances here?
-Yes, it's four meters up there.

314
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:06,960
The graphics clearly show
that the ship's side has been pressed in.

315
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,520
If one compares with known explosions-

316
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,880
-on the USS Cole or the tankers
in the Persian Gulf this year

317
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,120
-you see that the metal is always bent
inward by explosions from outside.

318
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:26,680
Outward if the explosion occurs from within.
As if something hits a hole in the hull.

319
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,600
I can not rule out an explosion-

320
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:47,880
-but I think it works
very unlikely that this is the case.

321
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:55,160
In that case, the metal would go a long way
to a greater extent have been bent inwards.

322
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:05,960
I do not see that peeling either
of color caused by explosions.

323
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:12,440
The metal is not bent enough
for it to be an explosion.

324
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,320
Based on the pictures and graphics
it appears as if

325
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,320
-that an external force
has been pressed into the hull side.

326
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:32,840
It's in the middle of ... The damage is
located right on the waterline.

327
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,920
Which indicates?

328
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,560
Given the location, the ship can
have been hit by another object.

329
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:51,840
But I do not have enough skills
to comment further on.

330
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:10,960
My name is Jørgen Amdahl and I am
Professor of Marine Engineering at NTNU.

331
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,200
My work largely consists of
analyzes of the consequences of

332
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,480
collisions between ships, and
between ships and oil platforms.

333
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,080
It's a pretty extensive injury.

334
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:44,400
It looks like
the color has been blown off

335
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:50,000
-which may indicate a collision
with one or another object.

336
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,880
An external influence.

337
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,120
The questions you are happy to ask yourself are:
How could this have happened?

338
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,360
And what is the reason?

339
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,920
There are many possible explanations
to how this may have happened.

340
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,440
The ship may have hit something
which floated in the water.

341
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,560
It could be the bow visor.

342
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:26,960
There should be damage to the bow visor
if that was what hit the page.

343
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,840
Yes, there is significant damage
on the book visor.

344
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,160
Let's see...

345
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:40,880
It's probably the bulb
who caused that.

346
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,720
On this page I do not see
particularly large scratch marks.

347
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:54,000
I see no marks indicating
that the bow visor caused the damage.

348
00:39:54,080 --> 00:40:00,720
That's weird. That's likely
that they collided with the bow visor.

349
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,720
Could it have been something else
on the sea surface?

350
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:14,000
The damage is so great
that one cannot exclude

351
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:19,000
-that it has had an impact
on the sinking process.

352
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:24,640
One can calculate, with quite large
accuracy, the force required

353
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,520
-to cause such damage.

354
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:35,720
You can also calculate which mass
the object that hit the ship had.

355
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,520
So this
should probably be investigated further.

356
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:06,240
Every autumn, at this time,
I feel an anxiety in my body.

357
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,360
I have been doing this every year since 1994.

358
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,640
Afterwards, I was told by eyewitnesses-

359
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:22,600
-that Hjørund was together
with his mother when the boat sank.

360
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:31,240
It was such a steep staircase
that Hjørund did not have the strength to climb up.

361
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:35,440
His mother
chose not to leave him.

362
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,840
She was not strong enough to get
with him Hjørund up the stairs.

363
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,560
I have been subjected to two abuses.

364
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,200
One is that the ferry sank
and I lost my son.

365
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:57,840
The second is that the Swedes decided
that the ferry would be left where it was.

366
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,200
There must be another reason
that they have not salvaged it.

367
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,720
Why is this still important today?

368
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,640
Because we do not know
how the accident happened.

369
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:21,840
For me, this is about the future
maritime safety for my descendants

370
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,080
-and in different parts of the world.

371
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:33,520
In such a great catastrophe,
as Estonia is

372
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:39,040
- you have to know what happened
and why it happened

373
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,080
-and above all
that it will not happen again.

374
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:48,560
And I'm convinced
that the truth will come to an end.

375
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,680
-I'm excited about what you've found.
-Yes I understand that.

376
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,720
Then we'll see ... What we have done-

377
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:45,160
-is that we have built up
an element model of the ship

378
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,880
-of a certain length.

379
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,520
Then we drove in an object
on the ship side

380
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,720
-to see what forces
and energies required

381
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:04,400
-to cause the damage
as you have observed with the ROV.

382
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,080
We see that the ship's side is pressed in.

383
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,680
We also get a crime
on the side plates of the vessel.

384
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:20,160
And an extensive deformation
of the frame and the half frame.

385
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:27,400
Here we have removed the bullet to get
a better insight into the course of the damage.

386
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:33,640
It is very obvious
how similar your animation is to reality.

387
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:40,160
The area of ​​damage is very similar
which has been observed with the camera.

388
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,000
We discovered that the maximum power
we get here is about 500-600 tons.

389
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,640
It is the force required to
that kind of damage should occur.

390
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:58,560
-God, it's a huge force.
-Yes, it's a pretty big force.

391
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,520
What does this really mean?

392
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:07,040
It can correspond
an object weighing one thousand tonnes

393
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:13,040
and moves at four knots.
A big fishing boat, maybe.

394
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:17,840
It can also be an object
weighing five thousand tonnes

395
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,680
-which moves at 1.9 knots.

396
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,360
It corresponds to
a medium-sized supply vessel.

397
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:33,960
This is a floating object
in the water there is no small object.

398
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:39,320
Even if it weighs a thousand tons
it is a large object.

399
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,040
It's absolutely incredible.

400
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:49,200
We last talked about the bow visor
may have hit the ship side.

401
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,280
The bow visor weighs 55 tons.

402
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:57,960
55 tons is a very small mass
in this context. It is.

403
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:03,840
If we are talking about a thousand tons
it would correspond to twenty bow visors.

404
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:11,800
The bow visor has not caused the damage.
I probably dare say so much.

405
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,680
So yes.

406
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,240
Shall we open the door?
I'm a little "shaken".

407
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,960
We talked about me
would ask you a lot of stuff-

408
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,600
-but I actually did
a little "sat out" of this.

409
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:39,160
I was a little surprised myself
while I was working on this.

410
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:43,080
You have not taken in so you crack?

411
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:48,560
No, we care about being objective.
We really are.

412
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:59,760
It is also possible to a stone
on the seabed, the vessel

413
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:03,000
-which may increase the power.

414
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:09,520
But that presupposes that it exists
stone there that supports the seabed.

415
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:13,520
But that possibility exists.

416
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:19,360
A bottom investigation was done when
one would "cover" with concrete.

417
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,920
There it is established that it is
a deep segment with loose clay

418
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,480
-which is then followed by
slightly harder moraine clay.

419
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,680
You go, of course
very deep down.

420
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,840
There is no indication that there are stones there.

421
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,320
It is not described
in the documentation, in any case.

422
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,080
No.

423
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:58,080
We've talked to first-hand sources,
especially those who survived the accident.

424
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,440
They have made exciting observations.

425
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,160
Here we have Carl Eric Reintamm,
who are survivors.

426
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:13,160
He is also up very early
walking deck. We can see a little.

427
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:20,280
When I get out of the ship
I do not see any people.

428
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:27,600
Where I am, there are no people.
I was one of the first to get there.

429
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:33,880
When I stand there, I look
of course out to sea, and down.

430
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,840
And then I see
something strange in the water.

431
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:44,400
I see something white that is
several times several meters large.

432
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,960
This is moving to the left

433
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:52,840
-and at the same time
then there are waves over this.

434
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,080
I've never done military service
and I have no idea

435
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,440
-how submarines look in the water.

436
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,280
It was dark in the water.
I have no idea-

437
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:09,360
-about a submarine
may look brighter than water.

438
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,600
But obviously
drove the ship on something.

439
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,880
What else can explain
that you hear sound

440
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:22,280
-which sounds
that the ship is driving through ice

441
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:28,880
-when you are down there where you are
hear everything that hits the ship?

442
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,040
Yes, of course it makes an impression.

443
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:45,800
And there are certain things
which can make one think a little extra.

444
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:51,840
Especially considering the
observations made at the bottom.

445
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,920
Does what he says sound reasonable?

446
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,320
I can not say
that it does not. He sees something.

447
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,680
And it is clear that it is ...

448
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,400
It is not certain that he sees everything.

449
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:14,280
A submarine is quite long, but he
must not have seen the whole submarine.

450
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:21,440
Submarines can weigh less than a thousand tons,
or several thousand tons.

451
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:26,320
We can see
if we can find some pictures.

452
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,000
"Kobben, submarine."

453
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,320
Does it say how big it is?

454
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,640
It's a pretty small boat.

455
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:45,640
We'll see if I can find more
information about the submarine's displacement.

456
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,440
Submarine failure ... In the Ula class, maybe?

457
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,240
A thousand tons.

458
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:04,200
Submarines like this
weighs about a thousand tons.

459
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,160
You can not pull any completely safe
conclusions based on this.

460
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:20,120
But anyhow
all testimonies should be evaluated.

461
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:24,000
This testimony
has never been valued.

462
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:30,680
It's an observation
which should be taken seriously. It is.

463
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:35,480
It's a mystery
how the ship was damaged.

464
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:42,400
If it happened before the ship sank
it's an even bigger mystery.

465
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:56,120
Based on the findings we have made,
what do you think should be done now?

466
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,920
Based on a technical and professional
estimate of the damage

467
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:07,720
- I think you should investigate
what may have caused the damage

468
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:15,040
-and if it may have contributed to
the course of events and its outcome.

469
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:22,080
This is new evidence
which no one has reported before.

470
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:27,160
Therefore, one must try to find
an explanation. I think so.

471
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:55,920
Accidents are usually followed by
different theories and explanations

472
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,840
-who depend on
different people's knowledge

473
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,200
-and, perhaps, the purposes.

474
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:10,680
Estonia is associated with
the many theories that have emerged

475
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:16,160
-but you have to be
open to discussing everything.

476
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:21,240
It is, in any case,
wrong to sweep things under the carpet

477
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:24,840
-because you fear the debate.

478
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,560
Welcome.

479
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,560
We have a fairly short presentation-

480
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:05,200
-where we want to inform about some
findings concerning the Estonian disaster.

481
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:11,480
During our work we have realized that
there are more question marks than answers

482
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:15,920
-about what happened to Estonia
on September 28, 1994.

483
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:22,120
You will see an ROV recording
of starboard side of Estonia.

484
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:26,720
It will set
The Estonia disaster in a new light.

485
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,800
If you follow the fender further now
then we have it as a reference.

486
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,640
Wait.

487
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,000
The boat ends here.

488
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,560
Oops, look!

489
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,920
That looks like a ... No.

490
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,080
That's too damn good!

491
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:47,320
Heads must roll here, then.
You can not talk this out.

492
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,480
It's an incredible injury.

493
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:53,520
This is a real scandal
which does not resemble anything.

494
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,760
I'm not just upset
- I'm pissed.

495
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,000
That's dramatic.

496
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:06,960
Especially that it was not discovered
when the accident report was written.

497
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,320
Shocking, actually.

498
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:16,120
It's something
which I have been waiting for all these years.

499
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,440
It seems to be revolutionary.

500
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:24,200
Now you have to admit tamejtusan
and tell me what really happened.

501
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,800
That knowledge exists,
and we want to know it!

502
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,640
A new investigation
is not really necessary.

503
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,040
But it is necessary
that one speaks the truth and tells:

504
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,560
"This is what happened."

505
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:38,880
This is a must
taken up as far as possible.

506
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,280
Whatever the consequences.

507
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,520
It is hard to say
what caused the hole-

508
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:52,360
-because it is something that has
hit the ship from the outside.

509
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:57,240
We did not know this before,
so it's a brand new find.

510
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:02,040
Why it has not been discovered
previously I can not answer.

511
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:08,640
All authorities should take a look.
Absolutely also Estonian authorities.

512
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,080
I'm looking at this
as a groundbreaking find.

513
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,640
After this, I think

514
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:24,080
-that it is impossible
for the Estonian authorities

515
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,560
-not to act.

516
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:39,680
-It's completely imprinted here.
-Yes, now I'm looking straight into the boat.

517
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:43,800
That was it. What do you think about it?

518
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:50,440
I think I need time
to melt the shaking images.

519
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:56,400
I feel insecure because
I'm not a maritime expert.

520
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:02,360
I'm not sure what I am
have seen and how I should interpret it.

521
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:07,960
The main problem is of course that
three countries have agreed

522
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:14,680
-that it should neither be allowed
to dive at or to film the wreck.

523
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,640
But can it be so
that the agreement in question

524
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:25,720
-when it comes to finding out
what happened to estonia?

525
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:32,120
We lack authority
to comment on that matter.

526
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:39,680
This is completely new information
which we must have time to digest.

527
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:45,880
We will pass this on
the information to our experts.

528
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:51,680
Then we'll see
what the next step will be.

529
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:58,200
Losing a loved one
in a disaster like this is difficult.

530
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:04,760
It takes time to get over.
That late, almost twenty-six years later-

531
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:10,600
- find out that it probably is
there has been a huge blackout-

532
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:15,200
-and that everything you have done that has
been so strange in the Estonia question-

533
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,320
-because you wanted to hide
the cause of the sinking ...

534
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:24,840
The conspiracy theories circulating
I have only devoted fleeting thoughts.

535
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:30,520
But when you look
such a large hole in the ship's side

536
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:35,160
-which no one has investigated
or followed up

537
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:39,240
-that's what you think
that it can be a turning point.

538
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,160
I feel a little that it has
been worth the wait so long.

539
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:46,320
That there is more hope now,
to find out.

540
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,320
I would like to
arrive at the truth now.

541
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:55,840
For us who have worked for many years
with this issue in different ways

542
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,800
-so this is not the end point,
but this is a starting point.

543
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:04,400
It is a starting point for the next phase
in the case of Estonia.
