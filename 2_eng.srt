1
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,600
She weighs only fifty kilos

2
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,360
She must probably be fed with a spoon

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,560
That Carita would
start working in Estonia-

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,320
- was nothing like us parents
had anticipated.

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,480
But she was
trained as a butler.

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:41,840
She had the task of educating
and train Estonian schoolchildren

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,360
-to become service-minded
in the right way.

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,440
I have to film this.

9
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,600
After turning off the movie camera
you should be beaten.

10
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,600
Carita came home one day and told

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,400
-that she had met
a guy named Peter.

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,520
He was also of her caliber:
that he was service-minded-

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,760
-and worked as a foreman
on board the ship.

14
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,080
Carita and Peter enjoyed traveling.

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,880
They had traveled the world
before they married

16
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,840
-to feel that they would
be able to thrive together in need and desire.

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,720
Peter told me
that he and Carita-

18
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,320
-had talked a lot
between each other.

19
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,640
Should anything happen on the Baltic Sea

20
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,560
that he or she should die,
how would the other then act?

21
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,720
They had promised each other
to correct the other person's body

22
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,160
-and pick up the body,
unless others did-

23
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,640
-and bury it
in a decent way.

24
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:07,280
Imagine a government
can counteract such a thing!

25
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,360
You take care of your loved ones
if you can.

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,920
I became aware of the disaster
around 05.50 in the morning

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
-when my clock radio turned on
on the morning prayer.

28
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,280
The search for survivors
from Estonia is now declining.

29
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,280
So far, 70-100 people have ...

30
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,920
Then I understood
that something must have happened.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,640
And then came the news at 6 o'clock.

32
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,560
One of the most devastating
ship accidents ever

33
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,360
-has occurred outside Utö
in the Åboland archipelago.

34
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,840
838 people are still missing-

35
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,880
-after the ferry Estonia
sank in the Baltic Sea last night.

36
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,800
There is a storm in the area, and
extensive rescue work is underway.

37
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,800
And the bulk of the 867 on board
thus followed Estonia in the deep.

38
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,200
Already during the first day,
September 28

39
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,720
-so you understand the extent of the accident.

40
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,880
In the morning we woke up
that the phone rang.

41
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,800
It was a relative who knew about
that Grandma and Bosse-

42
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,840
-had gone to Estonia by ferry.

43
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,880
When I get to the ferry terminal
then I'm met by Peter.

44
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:04,440
Then Peter and I find out
that Carita probably has not survived.

45
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,440
It is
a terrible information to get.

46
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,600
So it's whole school classes,
groups, workplaces

47
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,200
-who has had employees on
this ship, which has perished.

48
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,000
Society is in shock.

49
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,640
Sadly dressed in a dark suit came
Prime Minister Carl Bildt to Turku.

50
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,080
Here he goes, together
with the Prime Minister of Finland, Esko Aho-

51
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,120
-and Estonian Mart Laar
discuss the rescue operation-

52
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,120
-and the further work
after the ferry disaster last night.

53
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,680
Everyone is anxious about
to find out what has happened-

54
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,200
-and what can be done
to prevent a recurrence.

55
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,200
It is very important to know
what happened on the ferry

56
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,320
-because it's a mystery.

57
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,600
We saw water rushing in
through the door at the front.

58
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:09,040
-Where did the water come from?
-The door at the front, where the cars drive out.

59
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,400
So water came in through
the front of the ferry? Through the book visor?

60
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,800
At this point
so I was in the engine room.

61
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,760
I saw it
on the camera in the engine room.

62
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,600
Who showed the bow?
And you saw water flowing in?

63
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,320
The cause of the accident
seems to have been

64
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,960
-to the book visor
was not properly closed.

65
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,920
Carl Bildt, it has come to light
information that a hatch on the boat

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,640
- should have been open
and thus taken in water.

67
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,920
How do you rate this?
What is the company's responsibility?

68
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,160
It is not my job to judge this,
but the Accident Investigation Board must do so.

69
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,600
This is one thing
for experts to assess.

70
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,880
When the disaster occurred
so we were between two governments.

71
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,480
An outgoing and an incoming,
for it had just been an election.

72
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,160
We had a resigning Prime Minister,
Carl Bildt-

73
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,160
-and we had an incumbent
Prime Minister, Ingvar Carlsson.

74
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,880
Both were asked about
their attitude. How would we do?

75
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,040
How to deal with the dead?
How to handle the ship?

76
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,520
I think we should do
very great effort-

77
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,600
-to save the dead, which of
taking into account not least the

78
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,760
-is something I see
as very, very important.

79
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,920
We have discussed that,
and that work must begin.

80
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,600
I consider all efforts
must be done to get the ship up.

81
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,800
No matter what it costs?

82
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,080
I am prepared to advocate that though
it costs a lot, so let's try.

83
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,080
Everyone wanted it to be investigated
in a constructive and good way.

84
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,800
You have to find out
how this accident could have happened.

85
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,000
Above all, to be able to prevent

86
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,840
-so that similar accidents
does not happen in the future.

87
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,200
Now they would investigate
this accident properly-

88
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,920
and rescue so many dead
and maybe even the ship.

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,880
That was it
the immediate, spontaneous thought.

90
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,320
It was completely obvious
and quite naturally, I think.

91
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,960
That you do it after an accident.

92
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,560
And especially this accident,
when there were so many people-

93
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:27,360
-who did not manage to get out,
but which remained inside the ship.

94
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,600
It felt like the whole community
were set to:

95
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,000
"We have to take care of this
in the right way."

96
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,400
It was something you had to do,
simply.

97
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:42,920
We relatives were very pleased
when both heads of government say

98
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,600
-that they should do everything that is in
their power to take up the dead.

99
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,040
Then I was filled with hope,
despite all the misery that had happened.

100
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,760
But after a week or so, we realized that
that was probably not really true.

101
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,320
About a week after the accident
so the new government took office.

102
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,000
Then you got a person responsible
to deal with the Estonia disaster:

103
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,760
It was Minister of Communications
Ines Uusmann.

104
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,280
When she started making her statements
so we felt:

105
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,000
"This is not going to be good."
Everything was a problem.

106
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:33,159
It takes about 28 days
from leaving the water surface

107
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,480
-until you are down with pressure-
chamber to equalize the pressure.

108
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,240
Many people think it is a giant
and complicated surgical

109
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,720
-to do something that has to do with Estonia
to do because she lies so deep.

110
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,280
But it's not deeper than that
if you put Estonia on the high

111
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,240
-so comes over 60 meters
to protrude above the water surface.

112
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,000
That's how shallow it is.

113
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,760
The responsibility that Ines Uusmann was given
was of course very extensive-

114
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,520
-and very difficult
for an inexperienced person to deal with.

115
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,440
So Ines Uusmann became very addicted
by the officials at the Swedish Maritime Administration.

116
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,400
And above all Johan Franson, who
then was chief legal officer at the Swedish Maritime Administration.

117
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,240
He had great influence over it
further the development of the whole issue.

118
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,040
With regard to the ship
lies at a great depth

119
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,520
-and with regard to
that the ship has a fairly large

120
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,840
-so it is, of course
from a technical point of view-

121
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,400
-an extraordinarily demanding task.

122
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,440
Johan Franson had been commissioned
by the government to investigate the possibility

123
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,840
-to rescue wrecks and the dead.

124
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,320
His report, which came
just a few weeks after the disaster

125
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,400
-begins to line up problems
with salvage.

126
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,520
Every diving job
on or in Estonia

127
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,640
-is of course
extremely risky.

128
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,120
Apart from the fact that the diver can get stuck -
a fear that every diver lives with

129
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,160
-so his umbilical cord can be damaged.

130
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,680
He could be injured by life rafts
which suddenly comes loose.

131
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,360
There are lots of shattered glass
which one can cut oneself on.

132
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,440
So there is a big problem,
according to my way of seeing it.

133
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,600
As well as there is one more
normally, major technical problem.

134
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,600
It feels like the change
in reporting

135
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,760
and attitudes about rescuing the dead
and ships immediately began

136
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,000
-then the Swedish Maritime Administration
had been commissioned to investigate.

137
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,640
And that led to the discussions
whether to salvage or not salvage

138
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,640
-started in earnest throughout the country.

139
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,400
Somehow it gets more finished
if you can salvage them-

140
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,120
-and get a funeral
in the usual way.

141
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,640
I have a certain understanding
for the relatives of Estonia.

142
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,800
That they want to pick up their remains
of what was once their family.

143
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,480
I have respect for that.
At the same time, I do not think

144
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,080
-that one should sacrifice more lives, if that
are now considered to be the risks that exist.

145
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,320
This is also the question of:
In what condition are you prepared

146
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,400
-to receive their relatives?
In any condition?

147
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,960
It sounds incredibly cruel,
but this is a catastrophic

148
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,920
- we never like each other
has been near in Sweden.

149
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,560
I think they should stay,
actually.

150
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,320
I do not think it is a special one
nice sight to bring up all the dead.

151
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,800
They are dead, and to me does not mean
a grave so awful much.

152
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,440
Why it became a question
whether to salvage or not salvage?

153
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,040
The first instinct was, after all
that the dead should be taken home.

154
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,440
But then this question arose:
Should you salvage or not salvage?

155
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,280
That it even got to be a question!

156
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,880
Yes, it will be so
that if you do not receive a clear message

157
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,640
-then speculation begins to flourish.

158
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,680
Everything from conspiracy theories
to pure speculation.

159
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,880
One can of course think that it can
have been a Soviet transport

160
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:18,080
-of some kind of weapon
or explosives or something like that.

161
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,080
And then you start to speculate.
Are they hiding something?

162
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,440
Why in the name of peace
do they not salvage the boat?

163
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,320
Ingvar Carlsson said
that he would do everything in his power

164
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,800
-to get the ship up.
He has not done anything.

165
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,800
-Is it worst not to get a message?
-Yes, that's what you want to know.

166
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,880
The relatives got to meet
Minister of Communications

167
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,680
-The Swedish Maritime Administration, the Danish Council of Ethics, etc.

168
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,560
And it was three hours long
emotional meeting.

169
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,720
Will it be a salvage or not?

170
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,840
That's why I came here
from Hudiksvall.

171
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,160
I've been driving the bus all morning.
Will it be a salvage?

172
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,440
I tamejfan I do not get an answer to that!

173
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,320
The relatives, who represent
all classes of society, had to learn

174
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,360
-how politicians and authorities speak
without giving any straight answers.

175
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,800
-You're not happy with today's ...?
-No no no.

176
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,600
Everything they say
is just to delay

177
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,440
-because we all
should distance themselves from this

178
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,960
-and not require salvage.
It's nothing else.

179
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,240
And for a pressured communication
Minister, it was difficult to explain

180
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,680
-why Ingvar Carlsson
did not line up.

181
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,160
He will surely meet them
repeatedly.

182
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,040
-Why did he not come today?
-He is not at home.

183
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,880
-They have offered to change dates.
-Yes, I can not answer that.

184
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:48,560
It turned out then gradually
that it capsized over more and more

185
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,600
-from that you would salvage
to not salvage.

186
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,200
And the Swedish government,
for example-

187
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,560
-to dispel anxiety
from relatives and other human

188
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,400
-friends and others concerned
of those who had died

189
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,360
- appointed an ethics council.

190
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:19,960
Composed more by ethics experts.
No technical experts.

191
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,280
They were quite novices at technology,
so to speak.

192
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:30,080
But they were a little more, shall we say,
experienced in ethical issues.

193
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,800
The council that was appointed
was commissioned by the government

194
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,920
-to give a recommendation on how to
would do with the salvage of the boat-

195
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,920
-and how to do
with the bodies.

196
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,560
My first thoughts were probably
that it was a trust-

197
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,800
-and that it was good
that they wanted the church to

198
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,280
-and that it was a well-composed one
group that I felt comfortable with.

199
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,240
I thought:
"I can 't say no to this."

200
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,160
"It's a confidence I get
and which I must stand up for. "

201
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,920
Whatever you come up with,
so this hurts people.

202
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,200
It is in the nature of the disaster

203
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,960
-that whatever decisions are made
that's how you hurt people.

204
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,680
Sometimes incredibly bad.
And who do wrong-

205
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,320
-it therefore depends on the outcome
of this process.

206
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,080
So I think
that it is very difficult.

207
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,560
We had to gather a lot of knowledge.

208
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,160
And it was clear that we were pretty
submitted to the knowledge submission-

209
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,280
-because we ourselves
in these matters ...

210
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,520
I have no idea
how to salvage a giant ship

211
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,080
-but I had to trust the pre-
draws we received in the Council of Ethics.

212
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,200
And it's always difficult when you
receives a presentation on a topic

213
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,560
-which you can not.
To be able to ask the right questions.

214
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,720
So it's clear we were extradited
to these reports we received.

215
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,480
In retrospect, we have understood
that the Council of Ethics was completely

216
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,680
-of recommendations
from the Swedish Maritime Administration.

217
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,360
And the same person as before,
then it was Johan Franson-

218
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,160
-which informed the group
about the situation with wrecks and the dead.

219
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,360
Johan Franson was probably quite in favor
not to salvage.

220
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,240
And he was a good debater.

221
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:26,480
At the time of the disaster in 1994, so be it
I am Sweden's ambassador to Estonia.

222
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,320
And I was asked to participate
in some of the meetings with the Council of Ethics

223
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,480
-to be ... What shall we call
it because? "Estonian expert."

224
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,440
At this first sitting
I was with-

225
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,960
-so was the aforementioned Franson
from the Swedish Maritime Administration

226
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,280
-but also a forensic pathologist
from the National Board of Forensic Medicine.

227
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,680
Then there was the slide show, among other things
from inside the submarine Ulven-

228
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,800
-who went on a mine
during the end of World War II.

229
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,200
And there were pictures shown
with bodies inside the submarine.

230
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:10,119
It was difficult to take pictures.
There were also oral descriptions-

231
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,960
-of what it would look like
inside Estonia.

232
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:20,040
With torn furnishings
who had then let go of their mounts.

233
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:26,240
A pure earthquake-like
landscape inside the ship

234
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,840
and with dead bodies ... pinned,
and so on.

235
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,880
So this was a talk
which lasted quite a long

236
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,440
-and that got us sitting there
to be silent, quite simply.

237
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:51,400
I think it was relevant.
There is no comparable event-

238
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,680
-in Swedish
moderately modern shipping history.

239
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,360
So I do not think so
that one needs to question.

240
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,920
What was more remarkable
I think

241
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,520
-that it was obvious
that those who preferred

242
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,160
-S Maritime Administration Franson,
forensic pathologists and others ...

243
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:19,760
It felt clear that they were in
the line to try to avert salvage.

244
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,880
Everything was put together
with the various reports we received.

245
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,600
That it was
such an incredibly much more difficult question

246
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,040
-than we ever
could have imagined us.

247
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,920
It was maybe 800 bodies like man
would try to get out and identify.

248
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,960
What would happen when they came up to
the surface? How long would this take?

249
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,000
What to do with the bodies
in a dignified manner?

250
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:54,200
How to identify them? We
went through questions at different levels-

251
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,520
-and where an ethical issue was also
not to expose living human beings

252
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,320
-for death
to salvage dead bodies.

253
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,880
It was a clear idea
that it would be a trauma

254
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,080
-for both divers and forensic doctors-

255
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,920
-when so many dead bodies
at the same time would be taken care of.

256
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,520
And that it could lead to

257
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,360
-to permanent mental but
for those involved.

258
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,480
The total reports we received
was that it became so complicated-

259
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,880
-so that it was
almost impossible.

260
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,560
In December 1994
hired Rockwater-

261
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:57,040
-of the Swedish Maritime Administration for
to examine the wreck after Estonia.

262
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:06,320
And the purpose was, as far as I understand,
so that the Swedish Maritime Administration

263
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,920
-could decide
whether Estonia could be salvaged or not.

264
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:20,480
They put together a team. I became
asked to dive in Estonia.

265
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,640
Me and the other divers
had to undergo an examination

266
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,440
-to ensure that we do not
had some trouble diving there-

267
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,160
-because we knew
that there would be corpses there.

268
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,040
The divers' job was actually-

269
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,080
-if you ignore
the tragic aspect and all the victims

270
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,600
-a pretty easy job.
It was not an advanced task.

271
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,240
We arrived at the scene of the accident
and made preparations.

272
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,720
We got a dive plan. We would
enter the cabins under the car tire.

273
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,840
The water depth at Estonia
was actually quite shallow.

274
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,120
I think the bottom was 85 meters.

275
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:13,000
A freediver can actually hold his breath
and descend to a depth of 85 meters.

276
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,840
We go into the diving bell,
closes it and goes down.

277
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,120
I remember it so clearly, how the hatch
opens when you reach 55 meters.

278
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,880
I looked out. We have a beautiful
lighting system on the outside of the watch.

279
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,320
My first thought was:
"It's crystal clear!"

280
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,520
The view was perfect. You could see
50 meters in front of him. Incredible!

281
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,400
The Baltic Sea may always look like this,
but it was amazing.

282
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,280
Estonia was an incomparable sight from above.
Beautiful, white ...

283
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,720
The keel was completely flawless,
as if the ship had just been launched.

284
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,840
We could see that it did not exist
some wreckage in the road

285
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,200
-so we moved the dive clock-

286
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,800
-to the place where we were going
cut us into the cabins.

287
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,440
It was reinforcing steel.
I managed to make a small hole-

288
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,160
-and listed in,
but I saw nothing in there.

289
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,400
I made the hole bigger and stuck in
hand to see if I felt anything.

290
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,920
Then I widened the hole
so that I could get in.

291
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,040
Okay, are you ready?

292
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,960
-We are ready when you are ready.
-Okay.

293
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,480
We went into the cabins under the deck.

294
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,800
Okay.
I'm outside the first cab.

295
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,000
We just wanted to see
if there was anyone in the cab.

296
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,680
-Okay. I'm opened the door.
-Okay.

297
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,240
I went into the first cab.

298
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,000
It was easy.
The cabins under deck were very small.

299
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,000
The question was:
"Stewart, can you see anything in the cabin?"

300
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,520
The visibility was perfectly okay.

301
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,920
But once I got in
then everything started to whirl up.

302
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,800
I feel like it's a body
next to me, but I can not see it.

303
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,200
-Can you feel a body next to you?
-Yes.

304
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,040
Okay. There is a body there ...

305
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,400
- Keep going, just.
-Roger.

306
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,680
We did not swim around inside
in Estonia and did as we pleased.

307
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,960
There were government officials on board.

308
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,840
They told us exactly where we were going
and what we would look for.

309
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,120
Just below you on the right
so I think there is a body.

310
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,840
-Yes, there are two bodies here.
-Is there two bodies there?

311
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,200
That's right.

312
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,360
Is it possible to take a close-up
which the doctor can get?

313
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,960
Our job was to follow orders.

314
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:15,240
They said to us, "Look here,
look over there. Look in the next cab. "

315
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,960
"If you come across a corpse,
be respectful and move on. "

316
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,120
"That's all you have to do."

317
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,960
What I want you to do is
to approach one of the bodies.

318
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,800
Take a picture of your face
with your helmet camera.

319
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,360
-Do you see?
-No.

320
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,640
Do you see now, then?

321
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,440
-The only thing I see is hair, really.
-Okay.

322
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,240
Should I lift it up
and turn it over?

323
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,280
Yes, if you can.

324
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,640
Okay. We've seen enough. Thanks.

325
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,520
Between dives,
when the guys came up from a

326
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,720
-so we talked about
what we had seen and done.

327
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,400
Some of the guys
searched in areas where it ...

328
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,560
There were dead everywhere.

329
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,360
So another body
on the other side of the door?

330
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,800
-Oh, there are lots of them!
-Yes.

331
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,520
-Okay. Are you doing well?
-Yes.

332
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,520
When we dived inside the shopping area ...

333
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,520
There were many bodies in there.

334
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:41,200
People had become trapped when they
tried to get out through the doors.

335
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,240
Some had run out of the cab
in just a bathrobe.

336
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,120
In fact, they still were
in relatively good condition.

337
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,520
Some wore lipstick -
as fine as two months earlier.

338
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,360
We passed them, one by one.
But all the time they thought:

339
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,040
"We are here now.
Why do we not just address them? "

340
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,600
-Are the bodies to your right?
-Yes.

341
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,520
-Okay. Continue on, just.
-Roger.

342
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:16,080
That we would not take up
the bodies ... It was outrageous.

343
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,600
We divers could have picked them up
in a few hours.

344
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,520
There had been no problem.

345
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,440
There were no practical obstacles
against taking up the bodies.

346
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,280
You put it in a body bag, you put it
it in the basket and lifts it up.

347
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,640
It may sound a little cynical-

348
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,880
-but this is how it works in practice:

349
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,960
Coffin - basket - hoist up to the surface.

350
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,680
But that was not our job.

351
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,040
We just needed a basket.

352
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,000
The authorities could have flown there
a forensic pathologist, if needed.

353
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:56,720
A phone call would have been enough:
"Yes, take up the bodies."

354
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,720
Why was it not said that way?
We were shocked.

355
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:13,520
Our conclusion then was that a large
number of bodies could have been taken up.

356
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:19,760
We located 125 victims
and documented them in the reports.

357
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,520
Of course we could have found more,
if that had been the goal.

358
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,520
Of course, there are not many
in relation to 852 deaths

359
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,680
-but there are still many.

360
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:39,840
We also reported that the ship,
in our opinion, could be salvaged.

361
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,480
It would undeniably
have been complicated-

362
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,200
-but we still considered
that it could be salvaged.

363
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:12,040
Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson
now provides information

364
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,040
-on the issue of salvage
of Estonia.

365
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,680
The issue of salvage
or not salvage-

366
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,560
-can be assessed
from different starting points.

367
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,960
There are all the practical problems
and the ethical issues.

368
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:34,600
But there is also
the wishes of individuals.

369
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:41,080
Relatives who each in their own way
mourns their loved ones.

370
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,280
Therefore, there is now no reason
to delay a decision.

371
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,160
The relatives and everyone else
has the right to

372
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,560
-even if it will be received
with the despair of some.

373
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,040
The Swedish Government's decision

374
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,880
-to the passenger ferry M / S Estonia
with the dead shall remain in the sea.

375
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,680
This afternoon decided
the Swedish government

376
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,920
-that the accident vessel should remain
on the seabed forever.

377
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
There is no financial
or technical reasons behind the

378
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,240
-without ethical values.

379
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,480
During the 30 years I have been
central political activity

380
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:40,240
-I have not been to one
so painful and such a difficult decision.

381
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,440
In the autumn, Ingvar Carlsson promised
that Estonia would be saved.

382
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,640
He apologizes for that today.

383
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,480
Had I known then what I know now-

384
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,240
-I would not
have pronounced me that way.

385
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,720
How can you as head of government-

386
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,680
- betray a promise
to behave civilly?

387
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,560
It's something you can not understand.

388
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,800
I'm hugely disappointed and pissed
because it turned out the way it did.

389
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,240
When the decision came
that they would not salvage the Estonian

390
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,120
-that's how it felt
as if the whole house of cards collapsed.

391
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,400
It feels like it's coming
a wall directly opposite you.

392
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,640
Someone said we would not salvage them
because we would be traumatized.

393
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,040
But it was more traumatic
to leave the bodies there.

394
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:36,360
25 years later we are still talking
about Estonia, and everyone wonders:Why?

395
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,160
It was a difficult decision to make,
and we knew from the beginning that many

396
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,840
-would be relieved, and many
would think it was the wrong decision.

397
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,080
I have a big pile of thank you letters-

398
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,280
-and I also have a pile of letters
where one thinks the decision was wrong.

399
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,800
I always had the feeling of
that the government and the

400
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,680
and the Council of Ethics
and those who conducted the

401
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:10,320
-done based on their starting points
as best they could ever.

402
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,320
Then the human is enough
not always to.

403
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:18,480
And we can make mistakes, even though we
have done the best we could.

404
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:23,880
I think the authorities
acting in general

405
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,400
in the case of Estonia,
has been completely insane.

406
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,960
And what will happen next
is even worse.

407
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:44,640
The place where M / S Estonia sank
shall be considered a burial site.

408
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,160
To ensure
that grave peace is respected

409
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,280
-shall the ship be covered
and special measures are taken

410
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,400
-to provide the burial site
legal protection.

411
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,640
Estonia will be covered
with stone or concrete

412
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,840
-to prevent grave looting.

413
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,520
We cover Estonia
for all the human

414
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,400
-who has felt a concern
for wreck looting.

415
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,080
There was
large amounts of alcohol on the boat.

416
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,840
The dead may have been wearing jewelry.

417
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:19,040
It was an awfully unpleasant thought-

418
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,320
-that strangers would
touch the dead bodies in the boat.

419
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,360
It was such an unpleasant thought.

420
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,680
But even if the decision has now been made
so the debate does not

421
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,960
-and the many perceptions
around the country's biggest disaster.

422
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,200
It has never before in history
put forward such an idea-

423
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,480
-like casting a ship
and all perished in concrete.

424
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,400
It's a senseless idea.
Why do you present such an idea?

425
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,120
It was a hostile atmosphere
at the meeting-

426
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,600
-between the relatives
to the Estonian Offen-

427
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,400
and representatives of the government
and authorities.

428
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,920
What is crucial, I think,
is that from the very beginning

429
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,840
-try to show respect
also for government decisions.

430
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,440
You talked about respect.

431
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,200
I think it's disrespectful
to cast people in concrete.

432
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,640
This would never happen
have happened in Norway!

433
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,840
We must not leave
a large group of relatives

434
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,400
-which will cause mental suffering
the rest of his life

435
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,440
-dependent on something
which happened after the disaster.

436
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,640
Every time I go to the cemetery
and looking at the memorial stone-

437
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:37,720
-and see the poem on the stone, I know
that Hjørund should have been here.

438
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,160
A piece of Hjørund should be here.

439
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,720
I still feel hope.

440
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,800
Hope he
to be taken up from the Baltic Sea.

441
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:55,360
Or that which one can find
can be taken up from the Baltic Sea.

442
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,400
I hope so.

443
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:03,080
It should have been done a long time ago,
but it may never be too late.

444
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,560
When Peter gets ready for himself-

445
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:37,840
-that the government does not
will address the fatalities

446
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:43,040
-then a thought is born in him:
"I have to arrange this myself."

447
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:52,400
Peter started planning this
action in January, February 1995-

448
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,360
-because he could not accept
this concrete shell.

449
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,400
He had made his promise to
Carita. He would live up to that.

450
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,520
It must be done legally.

451
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:11,040
And then it must happen
before the peace of peace came into force.

452
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,120
He had received insurance money,
so he could afford

453
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:20,080
-to cost on this operation.
With the help of a German boat

454
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,560
-so he could go
to the sinking site.

455
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,920
He had managed to get the right ones
the coordinates of finding the ship.

456
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,640
Then he would with the help of
and s.k. ROV take up Carita's body.

457
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,000
Peter had spoken
with Carita's surviving friends.

458
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,240
They had told me
what her end looked like.

459
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,960
And he knew exactly
was it was somewhere.

460
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,440
He had worked on the ship himself
and knew very well what it looked like.

461
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,800
So there were no problems at all
to try to find her.

462
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,760
And so this is the days before
the Tomb Peace Act enters into force.

463
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,960
So it's okay to go out.

464
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,680
But what happened was
that since the Swedish government

465
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,120
- knew about his expedition,
so they sent out an icebreaker.

466
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,440
Fairplay VII.
This is the icebreaker Ale.

467
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:37,040
This area is
according to Swedish, Finnish and Estonian

468
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:43,560
-the last resting place
for the victims on board the Estonia ferry.

469
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,760
Can you respect that
and leave the area? Come on.

470
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,720
Imagine a government
can counteract such a thing!

471
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,400
Fairplay VII, Fairplay VII.

472
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:09,520
Do not lower any equipment
for photography or the like.

473
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,160
I will call
the Finnish Coast Guard

474
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,320
-and inform them
about your intentions. Come on.

475
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,640
Then Ale gets there
and make waves like this.

476
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,800
It is completely forbidden
according to international law.

477
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:40,880
So they can not do this
the attempt to take up Carita's body.

478
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,160
So he had to give up this attempt.

479
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,240
I thought I was a citizen
in a civilized country.

480
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,520
But apparently I'm not,
because the state does not want to take

481
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,400
-about their citizens.

482
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,320
I think that about Carita's body
had been reimbursed

483
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,800
and we had to bury her
in the grave we have-

484
00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:00,480
-and where Peter is alone now,
then it would have meant peace for us.

485
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,400
We could have moved on in this life
and thinks that:

486
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,040
"It was awful,
what happened"-

487
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,360
- "but we have in any case
brought home her body "-

488
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,280
- "and been able to bury it
in a decent way. "

489
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,360
Late last night
came the special vessel Tertnes

490
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,520
-to the place where Estonia sank,
with ten thousand tons of crushed stone.

491
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,760
Today, the crew has measured out
exactly where Estonia is located.

492
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,800
Tomorrow morning
if you start emptying the cargo

493
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,920
-to strengthen the seabed
around the wreck.

494
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,760
As a normal person who thinks,
so it is completely illogical-

495
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:57,080
-that you cover a ship with concrete
after an accident.

496
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,240
If it was a completely normal accident.

497
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,880
What did the authorities get
to make these decisions

498
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,000
-so completely opposite
against what you normally do?

499
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,960
You do not know
if this was really an accident.

500
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,400
It may actually have been
something else that happened out there.

501
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,040
To me, it seems that man
tried to hide something with it all.

502
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,400
The only thing I know is that Hjørund
is located somewhere in the Baltic Sea.

503
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,360
But no one tells
why he's lying there.

504
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,400
They just picked up the bow visor.
But that does not say much.

505
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,600
It just fell off. Why
in all peace they do not salvage the boat?

506
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,640
Are they hiding something?

507
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:44,320
The investigation has not been able to explain
why Estonia sank so fast.

508
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,400
Water came in on car tires,
and then the ferry sank.

509
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,600
There is no explanation
to why it sank.

510
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,920
It feels like you
has skipped a bit.

511
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,480
"The bow visor comes loose,
water enters the car tire "-

512
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,480
- "which lowers the ship."
What a ship should do then

513
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,440
-according to physical laws,
is to capsize.

514
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,200
And then they point to Jan Heweliusz.

515
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,760
She capsized.
She floated for a week or so.

516
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:13,840
For the ship to sink, it must
air mass is displaced by water.

517
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,280
So there must be
some kind of cavity-

518
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,320
-or openings in the ship
which causes it to sink.

519
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,800
The researchers say:
"I have never been" -

520
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,240
- "that a ship such as Estonia
drops so fast "-

521
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,960
- "if there has not been a hole
below the waterline. "

522
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,640
And it is not even investigated!

523
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,120
Why is it like that?

524
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,720
Why has it not been done?
What do you want to hide?

525
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,760
What do you not want?
let come?
